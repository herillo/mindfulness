  interested in Buddhism and Buddhist meditation. He is now president of the Bhavana
  Society in West Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley, about 100 miles from Washington,
  D.C. teaching meditation and conducting meditation retreats.
* Preface
  In my experience I found that the most effective way to express something in order to
  make others understand is to use the simplest language. Also I learned from teaching
  that the more rigid the language the less effective it is. People do not respond to very
  stern and rigid language especially when we try to teach something which normally people
  don't engage in during their daily life. Meditation appears to them as something that
  they cannot always do. As more people turn to meditation, they need more simplified
  instructions so they can practice by themselves without a teacher around. This book is
  the result of requests made by many meditators who need a very simple book written in
  ordinary colloquial language.

  In preparing this book I have been helped by many of my friends. I am deeply grateful to
  all of them. Especially I would like to express my deepest appreciation and sincere
  gratitude to John Patticord, Daniel J. Olmsted, Matthew Flickstein, Carol Flickstein,
  Patrick Hamilton, Genny Hamilton, Bill Mayne, Bhikkhu Dang Pham Jotika and Bhikkhu Sona
  for their most valuable suggestions, comments and criticisms of numerous points in
  preparing this book. Also thanks to Reverend Sister Sama and Chris O'Keefe for their
  support in production efforts.

* Introduction, American Buddhism
  The subject of this book is Vipassana meditation practice. Repeat, practice. This is a
  meditation manual, a nuts-and-bolts, step-by-step guide to Insight meditation. It is
  meant to be practical. It is meant for use. There are already many comprehensive books
  on Buddhism as a philosophy, and on the theoretical aspects of Buddhist meditation. If
  you are interested in that material we urge you to read those books. Many of them are
  excellent. This book is a 'How to.' It is written for those who actually want to
  meditate and especially for those who want to start now. There are very few qualified
  teachers of the Buddhist style of meditation in the United States of America. It is our
  intention to give you the basic data you need to get off to a flying start. Only those
  who follow the instructions given here can say whether we have succeeded or failed. Only
  those who actually meditate regularly and diligently can judge our effort. No book can
  possibly cover every problem that a meditator may run into. You will need to meet a
  qualified teacher eventually. In the mean time, however, these are the basic ground
  rules; a full understanding of these pages will take you a very long way.
  
  There are many styles of meditation. Every major religious tradition has some sort of
  procedure which they call meditation, and the word is often very loosely used. Please
  understand that this volume deals exclusively with the Vipassana style of meditation as
  taught and practiced in South and Southeast Asian Buddhism. It is often translated as
  Insight meditation, since the purpose of this system is to give the meditator insight into
  the nature of reality and accurate understanding of how everything works.
  
  Buddhism as a whole is quite different from the theological religions with which
  Westerners are most familiar. It is a direct entrance to a spiritual or divine realm
  without addressing deities or other 'agents'. Its flavor is intensely clinical, much more
  akin to what we would call psychology than to what we would usually call religion. It is
  an ever-ongoing investigation of reality, a microscopic examination of the very process of
  perception. Its intention is to pick apart the screen of lies and delusions through which
  we normally view the world, and thus to reveal the face of ultimate reality. Vipassana
  meditation is an ancient and elegant technique for doing just that.
  
  Theravada Buddhism presents us with an effective system for exploring the deeper levels of
  the mind, down to the very root of consciousness itself. It also offers a considerable
  system of reverence and rituals in which those techniques are contained. This beautiful
  tradition is the natural result of its 2,500-year development within the highly
  traditional cultures of South and Southeast Asia.
  
  In this volume, we will make every effort to separate the ornamental and the fundamental
  and to present only the naked plain truth itself. Those readers who are of a ritual bent
  may investigate the Theravada practice in other books, and will find there a vast wealth
  of customs and ceremony, a rich tradition full of beauty and significance. Those of a more
  clinical bent may use just the techniques themselves, applying them within whichever
  philosophical and emotional context they wish. The practice is the thing. The distinction
  between Vipassana meditation and other styles of meditation is crucial and needs to be
  fully understood. Buddhism addresses two major types of meditation. They are different
  mental skills, modes of functioning or qualities of consciousness. In Pali, the original
  language of Theravada literature, they are called 'Vipassana' and 'Samatha'.
  
  'Vipassana' can be translated as 'insight', a clear awareness of exactly what is happening
  as it happens. 'Samatha' can be translated as 'concentration' or 'tranquility'. It is a
  state in which the mind is brought to rest, focused only on one item and not allowed to
  wander. When this is done, a deep calm pervades body and mind, a state of tranquility
  which must be experienced to be understood. Most systems of meditation emphasize the
  Samatha component. The meditator focuses his mind upon some items, such as prayer, a
  certain type of box, a chant, a candle flame, a religious image or whatever, and excludes
  all other thoughts and perceptions from his consciousness. The result is a state of
  rapture which lasts until the meditator ends the session of sitting. It is beautiful,
  delightful meaningful and alluring, but only temporary. Vipassana meditation address the
  other component, insight.
  
  The Vipassana meditator uses his concentration as a tool by which his awareness can chip
  away at the wall of illusion which cuts him off from the living light of reality. It is a
  gradual process of ever-increasing awareness and into the inner workings of reality
  itself. It takes years, but one day the meditator chisels through that wall and tumbles
  into the presence of light. The transformation is complete. It's called liberation, and
  it's permanent. Liberation is the goal of all buddhist systems of practice. But the routes
  to attainment of the end are quite diverse.
  
  There are an enormous number of distinct sects within Buddhism. But they divide into two
  broad streams of thought-Mahayana and Theravada. Mahayana Buddhism prevails throughout
  East Asia, shaping the cultures of China, Korea, Japan, Nepal, Tibet and Vietnam. The most
  widely known of the Mahayana systems is Zen, practiced mainly in Japan, Korea, Vietnam and
  the United States. The Theravada system of practice prevails in South and Southeast Asia
  in the countries of Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma, Laos and Cambodia. This book deals with
  Theravada practice.
  
  The traditional Theravada literature describes the techniques of both Samatha
  (concentration and tranquility of mind) and Vipassana (insight or clear awareness). There
  are forty different subjects of meditation described in the Pali literature. They are
  recommended as objects of concentration and as subjects of investigation leading to
  insight. But this is a basic manual, and we limit our discussion to the most fundamental
  of those recommended objects--breathing. This book is an introduction to the attainment of
  mindfulness through bare attention to, and clear comprehension of, the whole process of
  breathing. Using the breath as his primary focus of attention, the meditator applies
  participatory observation to the entirety of his own perceptual universe. He learns to
  watch changes occurring in all physical experiences, in feelings and in perceptions. He
  learns to study his own mental activities and the fluctuations in the character of
  consciousness itself. All of these changes are occurring perpetually and are present in
  every moment of our experiences.
  
  Meditation is a living activity, an inherently experiential activity. It cannot be taught
  as a purely scholastic subject. The living heart of the process must come from the
  teacher's own personal experience. Nevertheless, there is a vast fund of codified material
  on the subject which is the product of some of the most intelligent and deeply illumined
  human beings ever to walk the earth. This literature is worthy of attention. Most of the
  points given in this book are drawn from the Tipitaka, which is the three-section
  collected work in which the Buddah's original teachings have been preserved. The Tipitaka
  is comprised of the Vinaya, the code of discipline for monks, nuns, and lay people; the
  Suttas, public discourses attributed to the Buddha; and the Abhidhamma, a set of deep
  psycho-philosophical teachings.
  
  In the first century after Christ, an eminent Buddhist scholar named Upatissa wrote the
  Vimuttimagga, (The Path of Freedom) in which he summarized the Buddha's teachings on
  meditation. In the fifth century A.C. (after Christ,) another great Buddhist scholar named
  Buddhaghosa covered the same ground in a second scholastic thesis--the Visuddhimagga, (The
  Path of Purification) which is the standard text on meditation even today. Modern
  meditation teachers rely on the Tipitaka and upon their own personal experiences. It is
  our intention to present you with the clearest and most concise directions for Vipassana
  meditation available in the English language. But this book offers you a foot in the
  door. It's up to you to take the first few steps on the road to the discovery of who you
  are and what it all means. It is a journey worth taking. We wish you success.

* Chapter 1 - Meditation Why Bother?
  Meditation is not easy. It takes time and it takes energy. It also takes grit,
  determination and discipline. It requires a host of personal qualities which we normally
  regard as unpleasant and which we like to avoid whenever possible. We can sum it all up
  in the American word 'gumption'. Meditation takes 'gumption'. It is certainly a great
  deal easier just to kick back and watch television. So why bother? Why waste all that
  time and energy when you could be out enjoying yourself? Why bother? Simple. Because you
  are human. And just because of the simple fact that you are human, you find yourself
  heir to an inherent unsatisfactoriness in life which simply will not go away. You can
  suppress it from your awareness for a time. You can distract yourself for hours on end,
  but it always comes back--usually when you least expect it. All of a sudden, seemingly
  out of the blue, you sit up, take stock, and realize your actual situation in life.
  
  There you are, and you suddenly realize that you are spending your whole life just
  barely getting by. You keep up a good front. You manage to make ends meet somehow and
  look OK from the outside. But those periods of desperation, those times when you feel
  everything caving in on you, you keep those to yourself. You are a mess. And you know
  it. But you hide it beautifully. Meanwhile, way down under all that you just know there
  has got be some other way to live, some better way to look at the world, some way to
  touch life more fully. You click into it by chance now and then. You get a good job. You
  fall in love. You win the game. and for a while, things are different. Life takes on a
  richness and clarity that makes all the bad times and humdrum fade away. The whole
  texture of your experience changes and you say to yourself, "OK, now I've made it; now I
  will be happy". But then that fades, too, like smoke in the wind. You are left with just
  a memory. That and a vague awareness that something is wrong.
  
  But there is really another whole realm of depth and sensitivity available in life,
  somehow, you are just not seeing it. You wind up feeling cut off. You feel insulated
  from the sweetness of experience by some sort of sensory cotton. You are not really
  touching life. You are not making it again. And then even that vague awareness fades
  away, and you are back to the same old reality. The world looks like the usual foul
  place, which is boring at best. It is an emotional roller coaster, and you spend a lot
  of your time down at the bottom of the ramp, yearning for the heights.
  
  So what is wrong with you? Are you a freak? No. You are just human. And you suffer from
  the same malady that infects every human being. It is a monster inside all of us, and it
  has many arms: Chronic tension, lack of genuine compassion for others, including the
  people closest to you, feelings being blocked up, and emotional deadness. Many, many
  arms. None of us is entirely free from it. We may deny it. We try to suppress it. We
  build a whole culture around hiding from it, pretending it is not there, and distracting
  ourselves from it with goals and projects and status. But it never goes away. It is a
  constant undercurrent in every thought and every perception; a little wordless voice at
  the back of the head saying, "Not good enough yet. Got to have more. Got to make it
  better. Got to be better." It is a monster, a monster that manifests everywhere in
  subtle forms.
  
  Go to a party. Listen to the laughter, that brittle-tongued voice that says fun on the
  surface and fear underneath. Feel the tension, feel the pressure. Nobody really
  relaxes. They are faking it. Go to a ball game. Watch the fan in the stand. Watch the
  irrational fit of anger. Watch the uncontrolled frustration bubbling forth from people
  that masquerades under the guise of enthusiasm, or team spirit. Booing, cat-calls and
  unbridled egotism in the name of team loyalty. Drunkenness, fights in the stands. These
  are the people trying desperately to release tension from within. These are not people
  who are at peace with themselves. Watch the news on TV. Listen to the lyrics in popular
  songs. You find the same theme repeated over and over in variations. Jealousy,
  suffering, discontent and stress.
  
  Life seems to be a perpetual struggle, some enormous effort against staggering odds. And
  what is our solution to all this dissatisfaction? We get stuck in the ' If only'
  syndrome. If only I had more money, then I would be happy. If only I can find somebody
  who really loves me, if only I can lose 20 pounds, if only I had a color TV, Jacuzzi,
  and curly hair, and on and on forever. So where does all this junk come from and more
  important, what can we do about it? It comes from the conditions of our own minds. It is
  deep, subtle and pervasive set of mental habits, a Gordian knot which we have built up
  bit by bit and we can unravel just the same way, one piece at a time. We can tune up our
  awareness, dredge up each separate piece and bring it out into the light. We can make
  the unconscious conscious, slowly, one piece at a time.
  
  The essence of our experience is change. Change is incessant. Moment by moment life
  flows by and it is never the same. Perpetual alteration is the essence of the perceptual
  universe. A thought springs up in your head and half a second later, it is gone. In
  comes another one, and that is gone too. A sound strikes your ears and then
  silence. Open your eyes and the world pours in, blink and it is gone. People come into
  your life and they leave again. Friends go, relatives die. Your fortunes go up and they
  go down. Sometimes you win and just as often you lose. It is incessant: change, change,
  change. No two moments ever the same.
  
  There is not a thing wrong with this. It is the nature of the universe. But human
  culture has taught us some odd responses to this endless flowing. We categorize
  experiences. We try to stick each perception, every mental change in this endless flow
  into one of three mental pigeon holes. It is good, or it is bad, or it is neutral. Then,
  according to which box we stick it in, we perceive with a set of fixed habitual mental
  responses. If a particular perception has been labeled 'good', then we try to freeze
  time right there. We grab onto that particular thought, we fondle it, we hold it, we try
  to keep it from escaping. When that does not work, we go all-out in an effort to repeat
  the experience which caused that thought. Let us call this mental habit 'grasping'.
  
  Over on the other side of the mind lies the box labeled 'bad'. When we perceive
  something 'bad', we try to push it away. We try to deny it, reject it, get rid of it any
  way we can. We fight against our own experience. We run from pieces of ourselves. Let us
  call this mental habit 'rejecting'. Between these two reactions lies the neutral
  box. Here we place the experiences which are neither good nor bad. They are tepid,
  neutral, uninteresting and boring. We pack experience away in the neutral box so that we
  can ignore it and thus return our attention to where the action is, namely our endless
  round of desire and aversion. This category of experience gets robbed of its fair share
  of our attention. Let us call this mental habit 'ignoring'. The direct result of all
  this lunacy is a perpetual treadmill race to nowhere, endlessly pounding after pleasure,
  endlessly fleeing from pain, endlessly ignoring 90 percent of our experience. Then
  wondering why life tastes so flat. In the final analysis, it's a system that does not
  work.
  
  No matter how hard you pursue pleasure and success, there are times when you fail. No
  matter how fast you flee, there are times when pain catches up with you. And in between
  those times, life is so boring you could scream. Our minds are full of opinions and
  criticisms. We have built walls all around ourselves and we are trapped with the prison
  of our own likes and dislikes. We suffer. Suffering is a big word in Buddhist
  thought. It is a key term and it should be thoroughly understood. The Pali word is
  'dukkha', and it does not just mean the agony of the body. It means the deep, subtle
  sense of unsatisfactoriness which is a part of every mental treadmill. The essence of
  life is suffering, said the Buddha. At first glance this seems exceedingly morbid and
  pessimistic. It even seems untrue. After all, there are plenty of times when we are
  happy. Aren't there? No, there are not. It just seems that way. Take any moment when you
  feel really fulfilled and examine it closely. Down under the joy, you will find that
  subtle, all-pervasive undercurrent of tension, that no matter how great the moment is,
  it is going to end. No matter how much you just gained, you are either going to lose
  some of it or spend the rest of your days guarding what you have got and scheming how to
  get more. And in the end, you are going to die. In the end, you lose everything. It is
  all transitory.
  
  Sounds pretty bleak, doesn't it? Luckily it's not; not at all. It only sounds bleak when
  you view it from the level of ordinary mental perspective, the very level at which the
  treadmill mechanism operates. Down under that level lies another whole perspective, a
  completely different way to look at the universe. It is a level of functioning where the
  mind does not try to freeze time, where we do not grasp onto our experience as it flows
  by, where we do not try to block things out and ignore them. It is a level of experience
  beyond good and bad, beyond pleasure and pain. It is a lovely way to perceive the world,
  and it is a learnable skill. It is not easy, but is learnable.
  
  Happiness and peace. Those are really the prime issues in human existence. That is what
  all of us are seeking. This often is a bit hard to see because we cover up those basic
  goals with layers of surface objectives. We want food, we want money, we want sex,
  possessions and respect. We even say to ourselves that the idea of 'happiness' is too
  abstract: "Look, I am practical. Just give me enough money and I will buy all the
  happiness I need". Unfortunately, this is an attitude that does not work. Examine each
  of these goals and you will find they are superficial. You want food. Why? Because I am
  hungry. So you are hungry, so what? Well if I eat, I won't be hungry and then I'll feel
  good. Ah ha! Feel good! Now there is a real item. What we really seek is not the surface
  goals. They are just means to an end. What we are really after is the feeling of relief
  that comes when the drive is satisfied. Relief, relaxation and an end to the
  tension. Peace, happiness, no more yearning.
  
  So what is this happiness? For most of us, the perfect happiness would mean getting
  everything we wanted, being in control of everything, playing Caesar, making the whole
  world dance a jig according to our every whim. Once again, it does not work that
  way. Take a look at the people in history who have actually held this ultimate
  power. These were not happy people. Most assuredly they were not men at peace with
  themselves. Why? Because they were driven to control the world totally and absolutely
  and they could not. They wanted to control all men and there remained men who refused to
  be controlled. They could not control the stars. They still got sick. They still had to
  die.
  
  You can't ever get everything you want. It is impossible. Luckily, there is another
  option. You can learn to control your mind, to step outside of this endless cycle of
  desire and aversion. You can learn to not want what you want, to recognize desires but
  not be controlled by them. This does not mean that you lie down on the road and invite
  everybody to walk all over you . It means that you continue to live a very
  normal-looking life, but live from a whole new viewpoint. You do the things that a
  person must do, but you are free from that obsessive, compulsive drivenness of your own
  desires. You want something, but you don't need to chase after it. You fear something,
  but you don't need to stand there quaking in your boots. This sort of mental culture is
  very difficult. It takes years. But trying to control everything is impossible, and the
  difficult is preferable to the impossible.
  
  Wait a minute, though. Peace and happiness! Isn't that what civilization is all about?
  We build skyscrapers and freeways. We have paid vacations, TV sets. We provide free
  hospitals and sick leaves, Social Security and welfare benefits. All of that is aimed at
  providing some measure of peace and happiness. Yet the rate of mental illness climbs
  steadily, and the crime rates rise faster. The streets are crawling with delinquents and
  unstable individuals. Stick your arms outside the safety of your own door and somebody
  is very likely to steal your watch! Something is not working. A happy man does not feel
  driven to kill. We like to think that our society is exploiting every area of human
  knowledge in order to achieve peace and happiness. We are just beginning to realize that
  we have overdeveloped the material aspect of existence at the expense of the deeper
  emotional and spiritual aspect, and we are paying the price for that error. It is one
  thing to talk about degeneration of moral and spiritual fiber in America today, and
  another thing to do something about it. The place to start is within ourselves. Look
  carefully inside, truly and objectively, and each of us will see moments when "I am the
  punk" and "I am the crazy". We will learn to see those moments, see them clearly,
  cleanly and without condemnation, and we will be on our way up and out of being so.
  
  You can't make radical changes in the pattern of your life until you begin to see
  yourself exactly as you are now. As soon as you do that, changes flow naturally. You
  don't have to force or struggle or obey rules dictated to you by some authority. You
  just change. It is automatic. But arriving at the initial insight is quite a
  task. You've got to see who you are and how you are, without illusion, judgement or
  resistance of any kind. You've got to see your own place in society and your function as
  a social being. You've got to see your duties and obligations to your fellow human
  beings, and above all, your responsibility to yourself as an individual living with
  other individuals. And you've got to see all of that clearly and as a unit, a single
  gestalt of interrelationship. It sounds complex, but it often occurs in a single
  instant. Mental culture through meditation is without rival in helping you achieve this
  sort of understanding and serene happiness.
  
  The Dhammapada is an ancient Buddhist text which anticipated Freud by thousands of
  years. It says: "What you are now is the result of what you were. What you will be
  tomorrow will be the result of what you are now. The consequences of an evil mind will
  follow you like the cart follows the ox that pulls it. The consequences of a purified
  mind will follow you like your own shadow. No one can do more for you than your own
  purified mind-- no parent, no relative, no friend, no one. A well-disciplined mind
  brings happiness".
  
  Meditation is intended to purify the mind. It cleanses the thought process of what can
  be called psychic irritants, things like greed, hatred and jealousy, things that keep
  you snarled up in emotional bondage. It brings the mind to a state of tranquility and
  awareness, a state of concentration and insight.
  
  In our society, we are great believers in education. We believe that knowledge makes a
  cultured person civilized. Civilization, however, polishes the person
  superficially. Subject our noble and sophisticated gentleman to stresses of war or
  economic collapse, and see what happens. It is one thing to obey the law because you
  know the penalties and fear the consequences. It is something else entirely to obey the
  law because you have cleansed yourself from the greed that would make you steal and the
  hatred that would make you kill. Throw a stone into a stream. The running water would
  smooth the surface, but the inner part remains unchanged. Take that same stone and place
  it in the intense fires of a forge, and the whole stone changes inside and outside. It
  all melts. Civilization changes man on the outside. Meditation softens him within,
  through and through.
  
  Meditation is called the Great Teacher. It is the cleansing crucible fire that works
  slowly through understanding. The greater your understanding, the more flexible and
  tolerant you can be. The greater your understanding, the more compassionate you can
  be. You become like a perfect parent or an ideal teacher. You are ready to forgive and
  forget. You feel love towards others because you understand them. And you understand
  others because you have understood yourself. You have looked deeply inside and seen self
  illusion and your own human failings. You have seen your own humanity and learned to
  forgive and to love. When you have learned compassion for yourself, compassion for
  others is automatic. An accomplished meditator has achieved a profound understanding of
  life, and he inevitably relates to the world with a deep and uncritical love.
  
  Meditation is a lot like cultivating a new land. To make a field out of a forest, first
  you have to clear the trees and pull out the stumps. Then you till the soil and you
  fertilize it. Then you sow your seed and you harvest your crops. To cultivate your mind,
  first you have to clear out the various irritants that are in the way, pull them right
  out by the root so that they won't grow back. Then you fertilize. You pump energy and
  discipline in the mental soil. Then you sow the seed and you harvest your crops of
  faith, morality , mindfulness and wisdom.
  
  Faith and morality, by the way, have a special meaning in this context. Buddhism does
  not advocate faith in the sense of believing something because it is written in a book
  or attributed to a prophet or taught to you by some authority figure. The meaning here
  is closer to confidence. It is knowing that something is true because you have seen it
  work, because you have observed that very thing within yourself. In the same way,
  morality is not a ritualistic obedience to some exterior, imposed code of behavior. The
  purpose of meditation is personal transformation. The you that goes in one side of the
  meditation experience is not the same you that comes out the other side. It changes your
  character by a process of sensitization, by making you deeply aware of your own
  thoughts, word, and deeds. Your arrogance evaporated and your antagonism dries up. Your
  mind becomes still and calm. And your life smoothes out. Thus meditation properly
  performed prepares you to meet the ups and down of existence. It reduces your tension,
  your fear, and your worry. Restlessness recedes and passion moderates. Things begin to
  fall into place and your life becomes a glide instead of a struggle. All of this happens
  through understanding.
  
  Meditation sharpens your concentration and your thinking power. Then, piece by piece,
  your own subconscious motives and mechanics become clear to you. Your intuition
  sharpens. The precision of your thought increases and gradually you come to a direct
  knowledge of things as they really are, without prejudice and without illusion. So is
  this reason enough to bother? Scarcely. These are just promises on paper. There is only
  one way you will ever know if meditation is worth the effort. Learn to do it right, and
  do it. See for yourself.
* Chapter 2 - What Meditation Isn't
  Meditation is a word. You have heard this word before, or you would never have picked up
  this book. The thinking process operates by association, and all sorts of ideas are
  associated with the word 'meditation'. Some of them are probably accurate and others are
  hogwash. Some of them pertain more properly to other systems of meditation and have
  nothing to do with Vipassana practice. Before we proceed, it behooves us to blast some
  of the residue out of our own neuronal circuits so that new information can pass
  unimpeded. Let us start with some of the most obvious stuff.
  
  We are not going to teach you to contemplate your navel or to chant secret
  syllables. You are not conquering demons or harnessing invisible energies. There are no
  colored belts given for your performance and you don't have to shave your head or wear a
  turban. You don't even have to give away all your belongings and move to a monastery. In
  fact, unless your life is immoral and chaotic, you can probably get started right away
  and make some sort of progress. Sounds fairly encouraging, wouldn't you say?
  
  There are many, many books on the subject of meditation. Most of them are written from
  the point of view which lies squarely within one particular religious or philosophical
  tradition, and many of the authors have not bothered to point this out. They make
  statements about meditation which sound like general laws, but are actually highly
  specific procedures exclusive to that particular system of practice. The result is
  something of a muddle. Worse yet is the panoply of complex theories and interpretations
  available, all of them at odds with one another. The result is a real mess and an
  enormous jumble of conflicting opinions accompanied by a mass of extraneous data. This
  book is specific. We are dealing exclusively with the Vipassana system of meditation. We
  are going to teach you to watch the functioning of your own mind in a calm and detached
  manner so you can gain insight into your own behavior. The goal is awareness, an
  awareness so intense, concentrated and finely tuned that you will be able to pierce the
  inner workings of reality itself.
  
  There are a number of common misconceptions about meditation. We see them crop up again
  and again from new students, the same questions over and over. It is best to deal with
  these things at once, because they are the sort of preconceptions which can block your
  progress right from the outset. We are going to take these misconceptions one at a time
  and explode them.
  
** Misconception #1 - Meditation is just a relaxation technique
    
    The bugaboo here is the word 'just'. Relaxation is a key component of meditation, but
    Vipassana-style meditation aims at a much loftier goal. Nevertheless, the statement is
    essentially true for many other systems of meditation. All meditation procedures stress
    concentration of the mind, bringing the mind to rest on one item or one area of
    thought. Do it strongly and thoroughly enough, and you achieve a deep and blissful
    relaxation which is called Jhana. It is a state of such supreme tranquility that it
    amounts to rapture. It is a form of pleasure which lies above and beyond anything that
    can be experienced in the normal state of consciousness. Most systems stop right
    there. That is the goal, and when you attain that, you simply repeat the experience for
    the rest of your life. Not so with Vipassana meditation. Vipassana seeks another
    goal--awareness. Concentration and relaxation are considered necessary concomitants to
    awareness. They are required precursors, handy tools, and beneficial byproducts. But
    they are not the goal. The goal is insight. Vipassana meditation is a profound religious
    practice aimed at nothing less that the purification and transformation of your everyday
    life. We will deal more thoroughly with the differences between concentration and
    insight in Chapter 14.
    
** Misconception #2 - Meditation means going into a trance
   
   Here again the statement could be applied accurately to certain systems of meditation,
   but not to Vipassana. Insight meditation is not a form of hypnosis. You are not trying
   to black out your mind so as to become unconscious. You are not trying to turn yourself
   into an emotionless vegetable. If anything, the reverse is true. You will become more
   and more attuned to your own emotional changes. You will learn to know yourself with
   ever- greater clarity and precision. In learning this technique, certain states do occur
   which may appear trance-like to the observer. But they are really quite the opposite. In
   hypnotic trance, the subject is susceptible to control by another party, whereas in deep
   concentration the meditator remains very much under his own control. The similarity is
   superficial, and in any case the occurrence of these phenomena is not the point of
   Vipassana. As we have said, the deep concentration of Jhana is a tool or stepping stone
   on the route of heightened awareness. Vipassana by definition is the cultivation of
   mindfulness or awareness. If you find that you are becoming unconscious in meditation,
   then you aren't meditating, according to the definition of the word as used in the
   Vipassana system. It is that simple.
   
** Misconception #3 - Meditation is a mysterious practice which cannot be understood
   
   Here again, this is almost true, but not quite. Meditation deals with levels of
   consciousness which lie deeper than symbolic thought. Therefore, some of the data about
   meditation just won't fit into words. That does not mean, however, that it cannot be
   understood. There are deeper ways to understand things than words. You understand how to
   walk. You probably can't describe the exact order in which your nerve fibers and your
   muscles contract during that process. But you can do it. Meditation needs to be
   understood that same way, by doing it. It is not something that you can learn in
   abstract terms. It is to be experienced. Meditation is not some mindless formula which
   gives automatic and predictable results. You can never really predict exactly what will
   come up in any particular session. It is an investigation and experiment and an
   adventure every time. In fact, this is so true that when you do reach a feeling of
   predictability and sameness in your practice, you use that as an indicator. It means
   that you have gotten off the track somewhere and you are headed for stagnation. Learning
   to look at each second as if it were the first and only second in the universe is most
   essential in Vipassana meditation.
   
** Misconception #4 - The purpose of meditation is to become a psychic superman
   
   No, the purpose of meditation is to develop awareness. Learning to read minds is not the
   point. Levitation is not the goal. The goal is liberation. There is a link between
   psychic phenomena and meditation, but the relationship is somewhat complex. During early
   stages of the meditator's career, such phenomena may or may not arise. Some people may
   experience some intuitive understanding or memories from past lives; others do not. In
   any case, these are not regarded as well-developed and reliable psychic abilities. Nor
   should they be given undue importance. Such phenomena are in fact fairly dangerous to
   new meditators in that they are too seductive. They can be an ego trap which can lure
   you right off the track. Your best advice is not to place any emphasis on these
   phenomena. If they come up, that's fine. If they don't, that's fine, too. It's unlikely
   that they will. There is a point in the meditator's career where he may practice special
   exercises to develop psychic powers. But this occurs way down the line. After he has
   gained a very deep stage of Jhana, the meditator will be far enough advanced to work
   with such powers without the danger of their running out of control or taking over his
   life. He will then develop them strictly for the purpose of service to others. This
   state of affairs only occurs after decades of practice. Don't worry about it. Just
   concentrate on developing more and more awareness. If voices and visions pop up, just
   notice them and let them go. Don't get involved.
   
** Misconception #5 - Meditation is dangerous and a prudent person should avoid it
   
   Everything is dangerous. Walk across the street and you may get hit by a bus. Take a
   shower and you could break your neck. Meditate and you will probably dredge up various
   nasty-matters from your past. The suppressed material that has been buried there for
   quite some time can be scary. It is also highly profitable. No activity is entirely
   without risk, but that does not mean that we should wrap ourselves in some protective
   cocoon. That is not living. That is premature death. The way to deal with danger is to
   know approximately how much of it there is, where it is likely to be found and how to
   deal with it when it arises. That is the purpose of this manual. Vipassana is
   development of awareness. That in itself is not dangerous, but just the
   opposite. Increased awareness is the safeguard against danger. Properly done, meditation
   is a very gentle and gradual process. Take it slow and easy, and development of your
   practice will occur very naturally. Nothing should be forced. Later, when you are under
   the close scrutiny and protective wisdom of a competent teacher, you can accelerate your
   rate of growth by taking a period of intensive meditation. In the beginning, though,
   easy does it. Work gently and everything will be fine.
   
** Misconception #6 - Meditation is for saints and holy men, not for regular people
   
   You find this attitude very prevalent in Asia, where monks and holy men are accorded an
   enormous amount of ritualized reverence. This is somewhat akin to the American attitude
   of idealizing movie stars and baseball heroes. Such people are stereotyped, made larger
   than life, and saddled with all sort of characteristics that few human beings can ever
   live up to. Even in the West, we share some of this attitude about meditation. We expect
   the meditator to be some extraordinarily pious figure in whose mouth butter would never
   dare to melt. A little personal contact with such people will quickly dispel this
   illusion. They usually prove to be people of enormous energy and gusto, people who live
   their lives with amazing vigor. It is true, of course, that most holy men meditate, but
   they don't meditate because they are holy men. That is backward. They are holy men
   because they meditate. Meditation is how they got there. And they started meditating
   before they became holy. This is an important point. A sizable number of students seems
   to feel that a person should be completely moral before he begins meditation. It is an
   unworkable strategy. Morality requires a certain degree of mental control. It's a
   prerequisite. You can't follow any set of moral precepts without at least a little
   self-control, and if your mind is perpetually spinning like a fruit cylinder in a one-
   armed bandit, self-control is highly unlikely. So mental culture has to come first.
   
   There are three integral factors in Buddhist meditation-- morality, concentration and
   wisdom. Those three factors grow together as your practice deepens. Each one influences
   the other, so you cultivate the three of them together, not one at a time. When you have
   the wisdom to truly understand a situation, compassion towards all the parties involved
   is automatic, and compassion means that you automatically restrain yourself from any
   thought, word or deed that might harm yourself or others. Thus your behavior is
   automatically moral. It is only when you don't understand things deeply that you create
   problems. If you fail to see the consequences of your own action, you will blunder. The
   fellow who waits to become totally moral before he begins to meditate is waiting for a
   'but' that will never come. The ancient sages say that he is like a man waiting for the
   ocean to become calm so that he can go take a bath. To understand this relationship more
   fully, let us propose that there are levels of morality. The lowest level is adherence
   to a set of rules and regulations laid down by somebody else. It could be your favorite
   prophet. It could be the state, the head man of your tribe or your father. No matter who
   generates the rules, all you've got to do at this level is know the rules and follow
   them. A robot can do that. Even a trained chimpanzee could do it if the rules were
   simple enough and he was smacked with a stick every time he broke one. This level
   requires no meditation at all. All you need are the rules and somebody to swing the
   stick.
   
   The next level of morality consists of obeying the same rules even in the absence of
   somebody who will smack you. You obey because you have internalized the rules. You smack
   yourself every time you break one. This level requires a bit of mind control. If your
   thought pattern is chaotic, your behavior will be chaotic, too. Mental culture reduces
   mental chaos.
   
   There is a third level or morality, but it might be better termed ethics. This level is
   a whole quantum layer up the scale, a real paradigm shift in orientation. At the level
   of ethics, one does not follow hard and fast rules dictated by authority. One chooses
   his own behavior according to the needs of the situation. This level requires real
   intelligence and an ability to juggle all the factors in every situation and arrive at a
   unique, creative and appropriate response each time. Furthermore, the individual making
   these decisions needs to have dug himself out of his own limited personal viewpoint. He
   has to see the entire situation from an objective point of view, giving equal weight to
   his own needs and those of others. In other words, he has to be free from greed, hatred,
   envy and all the other selfish junk that ordinarily keeps us from seeing the other guy's
   side of the issue. Only then can he choose that precise set of actions which will be
   truly optimal for that situation. This level of morality absolutely demands meditation,
   unless you were born a saint. There is no other way to acquire the skill. Furthermore,
   the sorting process required at this level is exhausting. If you tried to juggle all
   those factors in every situation with your conscious mind, you'd wear yourself out. The
   intellect just can't keep that many balls in the air at once. It is an
   overload. Luckily, a deeper level of consciousness can do this sort of processing with
   ease. Meditation can accomplish the sorting process for you. It is an eerie feeling.
   
   One day you've got a problem - say to handle Uncle Herman's latest divorce. It looks
   absolutely unsolvable, and an enormous muddle of 'maybes' that would give Solomon
   himself the willies. The next day you are washing the dishes, thinking about something
   else entirely, and suddenly the solution is there. It just pops out of the deep mind and
   you say, 'Ah ha!' and the whole thing is solved. This sort of intuition can only occur
   when you disengage the logic circuits from the problem and give the deep mind the
   opportunity to cook up the solution. The conscious mind just gets in the way. Meditation
   teaches you how to disentangle yourself from the thought process. It is the mental art
   of stepping out of your own way, and that's a pretty useful skill in everyday
   life. Meditation is certainly not some irrelevant practice strictly for ascetics and
   hermits. It is a practical skill that focuses on everyday events and has immediate
   application in everybody's life. Meditation is not otherworldly.
   
   Unfortunately, this very fact constitutes the drawback for certain students. They enter
   the practice expecting instantaneous cosmic revelation, complete with angelic
   choirs. What they usually get is a more efficient way to take out the trash and better
   ways to deal with Uncle Herman. They are needlessly disappointed. The trash solution
   comes first. The voices of archangels take a bit longer.
   
** Misconception #7 - Meditation is running away from reality
   
   Incorrect. Meditation is running into reality. It does not insulate you from the pain of
   life. It allows you to delve so deeply into life and all its aspects that you pierce the
   pain barrier and you go beyond suffering. Vipassana is a practice done with the specific
   intention of facing reality, to fully experience life just as it is and to cope with
   exactly what you find. It allows you to blow aside the illusions and to free yourself
   from all those polite little lies you tell yourself all the time. What is there is
   there. You are who you are, and lying to yourself about your own weaknesses and
   motivations only binds you tighter to the wheel of illusion. Vipassana meditation is not
   an attempt to forget yourself or to cover up your troubles. It is learning to look at
   yourself exactly as you are. See what is there, accept it fully. Only then can you
   change it.
   
** Misconception #8 - Meditation is a great way to get high
   
   Well, yes and no. Meditation does produce lovely blissful feelings sometimes. But they
   are not the purpose, and they don't always occur. Furthermore, if you do meditation with
   that purpose in mind, they are less likely to occur than if you just meditate for the
   actual purpose of meditation, which is increased awareness. Bliss results from
   relaxation, and relaxation results from release of tension. Seeking bliss from
   meditation introduces tension into the process, which blows the whole chain of
   events. It is a Catch-22. You can only have bliss if you don't chase it. Besides, if
   euphoria and good feelings are what you are after, there are easier ways to get
   them. They are available in taverns and from shady characters on the street corners all
   across the nation. Euphoria is not the purpose of meditation. It will often arise, but
   is to be regarded as a by-product. Still, it is a very pleasant side-effect, and it
   becomes more and more frequent the longer you meditate. You won't hear any disagreement
   about this from advanced practitioners.
   
** Misconception #9 - Meditation is selfish
   
   It certainly looks that way. There sits the meditator parked on his little cushion. Is
   he out giving blood? No. Is he busy working with disaster victims? No. But let us
   examine his motivation. Why is he doing this? His intention is to purge his own mind of
   anger, prejudice and ill-will. He is actively engaged in the process of getting rid of
   greed, tension and insensitivity. Those are the very items which obstruct his compassion
   for others. Until they are gone, any good works that he does are likely to be just an
   extension of his own ego and of no real help in the long run. Harm in the name of help
   is one of the oldest games. The grand inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition spouts the
   loftiest of motives. The Salem witchcraft trials were conducted for the public
   good. Examine the personal lives of advanced meditators and you will often find them
   engaged in humanitarian service. You will seldom find them as crusading missionaries who
   are willing to sacrifice certain individuals for the sake of some pious idea. The fact
   is we are more selfish than we know. The ego has a way of turning the loftiest
   activities into trash if it is allowed free range. Through meditation we become aware of
   ourselves exactly as we are, by waking up to the numerous subtle ways that we manifest
   our own selfishness. Then we truly begin to be genuinely selfless. Cleansing yourself of
   selfishness is not a selfish activity.
   
** Misconception #10 - When you meditate, you sit around thinking lofty thoughts
   
   Wrong again. There are certain systems of contemplation in which this sort of thing is
   done. But that is not Vipassana. Vipassana is the practice of awareness. Awareness of
   whatever is there, be it supreme truth or crummy trash. What is there is there. Of
   course, lofty aesthetic thoughts may arise during your practice. They are certainly not
   to be avoided. Neither are they to be sought. They are just pleasant
   side-effects. Vipassana is a simple practice. It consists of experiencing your own life
   events directly, without preference and without mental images pasted to them. Vipassana
   is seeing your life unfold from moment to moment without biases. What comes up comes
   up. It is very simple.
   
** Misconception #11 - A couple of weeks of meditation and all my problems will go away
   
   Sorry, meditation is not a quick cure-all. You will start seeing changes right away, but
   really profound effects are years down the line. That is just the way the universe is
   constructed. Nothing worthwhile is achieved overnight. Meditation is tough in some
   respects. It requires a long discipline and sometimes a painful process of practice. At
   each sitting you gain some results, but those results are often very subtle. They occur
   deep within the mind, only to manifest much later. And if you are sitting there
   constantly looking for some huge instantaneous changes, you will miss the subtle shifts
   altogether. You will get discouraged, give up and swear that no such changes will ever
   occur. Patience is the key. Patience. If you learn nothing else from meditation, you
   will learn patience. And that is the most valuable lesson available.
* Chapter 3 - What Meditation Is
  Meditation is a word, and words are used in different ways by different speakers. This
  may seem like a trivial point, but it is not. It is quite important to distinguish
  exactly what a particular speaker means by the words he uses. Every culture on earth,
  for example, has produced some sort of mental practice which might be termed
  meditation. It all depends on how loose a definition you give to that word. Everybody
  does it, from Africans to Eskimos. The techniques are enormously varied, and we will
  make no attempt to survey them. There are other books for that. For the purpose of this
  volume, we will restrict our discussion to those practices best known to Western
  audiences and most likely associated with the term meditation.
  
  Within the Judeo-Christian tradition we find two overlapping practices called prayer and
  contemplation. Prayer is a direct address to some spiritual entity. Contemplation is a
  prolonged period of conscious thought about some specific topic, usually a religious
  ideal or scriptural passage. From the standpoint of mental culture, both of these
  activities are exercises in concentration. The normal deluge of conscious thought is
  restricted, and the mind is brought to one conscious area of operation. The results are
  those you find in any concentrative practice: deep calm, a physiological slowing of the
  metabolism and a sense of peace and well-being.
  
  Out of the Hindu tradition comes Yogic meditation, which is also purely
  concentrative. The traditional basic exercises consist of focusing the mind on a single
  object: a stone, a candle flame, a syllable or whatever, and not allowing it to
  wander. Having acquired the basic skill, the Yogi proceeds to expand his practice by
  taking on more complex objects of meditation: chants, colorful religious images, energy
  channels in the body and so forth. Still, no matter how complex the object of
  meditation, the meditation itself remains purely an exercise in concentration.
  
  Within the Buddhist tradition, concentration is also highly valued. But a new element is
  added and more highly stressed. That element is awareness. All Buddhist meditation aims
  at the development of awareness, using concentration as a tool. The Buddhist tradition
  is very wide, however, and there are several diverse routes to this goal. Zen meditation
  uses two separate tacks. The first is the direct plunge into awareness by sheer force of
  will. You sit down and you just sit, meaning that you toss out of your mind everything
  except pure awareness of sitting. This sounds very simple. It is not. A brief trial will
  demonstrate just how difficult it really is. The second Zen approach used in the Rinzai
  school is that of tricking the mind out of conscious thought and into pure
  awareness. This is done by giving the student an unsolvable riddle which he must solve
  anyway, and by placing him in a horrendous training situation. Since he cannot flee from
  the pain of the situation, he must flee into a pure experience of the moment. There is
  nowhere else to go. Zen is tough. It is effective for many people, but it is really
  tough.
  
  Another stratagem, Tantric Buddhism, is nearly the reverse. Conscious thought, at least
  the way we usually do it, is the manifestation of ego, the you that you usually think
  that you are. Conscious thought is tightly connected with self-concept. The self-concept
  or ego is nothing more than a set of reactions and mental images which are artificially
  pasted to the flowing process of pure awareness. Tantra seeks to obtain pure awareness
  by destroying this ego image. This is accomplished by a process of visualization. The
  student is given a particular religious image to meditate upon, for example, one of the
  deities from the Tantric pantheon. He does this in so thorough a fashion that he becomes
  that entity. He takes off his own identity and puts on another. This takes a while, as
  you might imagine, but it works. During the process, he is able to watch the way that
  the ego is constructed and put in place. He comes to recognize the arbitrary nature of
  all egos, including his own, and he escapes from bondage to the ego. He is left in a
  state where he may have an ego if he so chooses, either his own or whichever other he
  might wish, or he can do without one. Result: pure awareness. Tantra is not exactly a
  game of patty cake either.
  
  Vipassana is the oldest of Buddhist meditation practices. The method comes directly from
  the Sitipatthana Sutta, a discourse attributed to Buddha himself. Vipassana is a direct
  and gradual cultivation of mindfulness or awareness. It proceeds piece by piece over a
  period of years. The student's attention is carefully directed to an intense examination
  of certain aspects of his own existence. The meditator is trained to notice more and
  more of his own flowing life experience. Vipassana is a gentle technique. But it also is
  very, very thorough. It is an ancient and codified system of sensitivity training, a set
  of exercises dedicated to becoming more and more receptive to your own life
  experience. It is attentive listening, total seeing and careful testing. We learn to
  smell acutely, to touch fully and really pay attention to what we feel. We learn to
  listen to our own thoughts without being caught up in them.
  
  The object of Vipassana practice is to learn to pay attention. We think we are doing
  this already, but that is an illusion. It comes from the fact that we are paying so
  little attention to the ongoing surge of our own life experiences that we might just as
  well be asleep. We are simply not paying enough attention to notice that we are not
  paying attention. It is another Catch-22.
  
  Through the process of mindfulness, we slowly become aware of what we really are down
  below the ego image. We wake up to what life really is. It is not just a parade of ups
  and downs, lollipops and smacks on the wrist. That is an illusion. Life has a much
  deeper texture than that if we bother to look, and if we look in the right way.
  
  Vipassana is a form of mental training that will teach you to experience the world in an
  entirely new way. You will learn for the first time what is truly happening to you,
  around you and within you. It is a process of self discovery, a participatory
  investigation in which you observe your own experiences while participating in them, and
  as they occur. The practice must be approached with this attitude.
  
  "Never mind what I have been taught. Forget about theories and prejudgments and
  stereotypes. I want to understand the true nature of life. I want to know what this
  experience of being alive really is. I want to apprehend the true and deepest qualities
  of life, and I don't want to just accept somebody else's explanation. I want to see it
  for myself." If you pursue your meditation practice with this attitude, you will
  succeed. You'll find yourself observing things objectively, exactly as they are--flowing
  and changing from moment to moment. Life then takes on an unbelievable richness which
  cannot be described. It has to be experienced.
  
  The Pali term for Insight meditation is Vipassana Bhavana. Bhavana comes from the root
  'Bhu', which means to grow or to become. Therefore Bhavana means to cultivate, and the
  word is always used in reference to the mind. Bhavana means mental
  cultivation. 'Vipassana' is derived from two roots. 'Passana' means seeing or
  perceiving. 'Vi' is a prefix with a complex set of connotations. The basic meaning is
  'in a special way.' But there also is the connotation of both 'into' and 'through'. The
  whole meaning of the word is looking into something with clarity and precision, seeing
  each component as distinct and separate, and piercing all the way through so as to
  perceive the most fundamental reality of that thing. This process leads to insight into
  the basic reality of whatever is being inspected. Put it all together and 'Vipassana
  Bhavana' means the cultivation of the mind, aimed at seeing in a special way that leads
  to insight and to full understanding.
  
  In Vipassana mediation we cultivate this special way of seeing life. We train ourselves
  to see reality exactly as it is, and we call this special mode of perception
  'mindfulness.' This process of mindfulness is really quite different from what we
  usually do. We usually do not look into what is really there in front of us. We see life
  through a screen of thoughts and concepts, and we mistake those mental objects for the
  reality. We get so caught up in this endless thought stream that reality flows by
  unnoticed. We spend our time engrossed in activity, caught up in an eternal pursuit of
  pleasure and gratification and an eternal flight from pain and unpleasantness. We spend
  all of our energies trying to make ourselves feel better, trying to bury our fears. We
  are endlessly seeking security. Meanwhile, the world of real experience flows by
  untouched and untasted. In Vipassana meditation we train ourselves to ignore the
  constant impulses to be more comfortable, and we dive into the reality instead. The
  ironic thing is that real peace comes only when you stop chasing it. Another Catch-22.
  
  When you relax your driving desire for comfort, real fulfillment arises. When you drop
  your hectic pursuit of gratification, the real beauty of life comes out. When you seek
  to know the reality without illusion, complete with all its pain and danger, that is
  when real freedom and security are yours. This is not some doctrine we are trying to
  drill into you. This is an observable reality, a thing you can and should see for
  yourself.
  
  Buddhism is 2500 years old, and any thought system of that vintage has time to develop
  layers and layers of doctrine and ritual. Nevertheless, the fundamental attitude of
  Buddhism is intensely empirical and anti-authoritarian. Gotama the Buddha was a highly
  unorthodox individual and real anti-traditionalist. He did not offer his teaching as a
  set of dogmas, but rather as a set of propositions for each individual to investigate
  for himself. His invitation to one and all was 'Come and See'. One of the things he said
  to his followers was "Place no head above your own". By this he meant, don't accept
  somebody else's word. See for yourself.
  
  We want you to apply this attitude to every word you read in this manual. We are not
  making statements that you would accept merely because we are authorities in the
  field. Blind faith has nothing to do with this. These are experiential realities. Learn
  to adjust your mode of perception according to instructions given in the book, and you
  will see for yourself. That and only that provides ground for your faith. Insight
  meditation is essentially a practice of investigative personal discovery.
  
  Having said this, we will present here a very short synopsis of some of the key points
  of Buddhist philosophy. We make no attempt to be thorough, since that has been quite
  nicely done in many other books. This material is essential to understanding Vipassana,
  therefore, some mention must be made.
  
  From the Buddhist point of view, we human beings live in a very peculiar fashion. We
  view impermanent things as permanent, though everything is changing all around us. The
  process of change is constant and eternal. As you read these words, your body is
  aging. But you pay no attention to that. The book in your hand is decaying. The print is
  fading and the pages are becoming brittle. The walls around you are aging. The molecules
  within those walls are vibrating at an enormous rate, and everything is shifting, going
  to pieces and dissolving slowly. You pay no attention to that, either. Then one day you
  look around you. Your body is wrinkled and squeaky and you hurt. The book is a yellowed,
  useless lump; the building is caving in. So you pine for lost youth and you cry when the
  possessions are gone. Where does this pain come from? It comes from your own
  inattention. You failed to look closely at life. You failed to observe the constantly
  shifting flow of the world as it went by. You set up a collection of mental
  constructions, 'me', 'the book', 'the building', and you assume that they would endure
  forever. They never do. But you can tune into the constantly ongoing change. You can
  learn to perceive your life as an ever-flowing movement, a thing of great beauty like a
  dance or symphony. You can learn to take joy in the perpetual passing away of all
  phenomena. You can learn to live with the flow of existence rather than running
  perpetually against the grain. You can learn this. It is just a matter of time and
  training.
  
  Our human perceptual habits are remarkably stupid in some ways. We tune out 99% of all
  the sensory stimuli we actually receive, and we solidify the remainder into discrete
  mental objects. Then we react to those mental objects in programmed habitual ways. An
  example: There you are, sitting alone in the stillness of a peaceful night. A dog barks
  in the distance. The perception itself is indescribably beautiful if you bother to
  examine it. Up out of that sea of silence come surging waves of sonic vibration. You
  start to hear the lovely complex patterns, and they are turned into scintillating
  electronic stimulations within the nervous system. The process is beautiful and
  fulfilling in itself. We humans tend to ignore it totally. Instead, we solidify that
  perception into a mental object. We paste a mental picture on it and we launch into a
  series of emotional and conceptual reactions to it. "There is that dog again. He is
  always barking at night. What a nuisance. Every night he is a real bother. Somebody
  should do something. Maybe I should call a cop. No, a dog catcher. So, I'll call the
  pound. No, maybe I'll just write a real nasty letter to the guy who owns that dog. No,
  too much trouble. I'll just get an ear plug." They are just perceptual and mental
  habits. You learn to respond this way as a child by copying the perceptual habits of
  those around you. These perceptual responses are not inherent in the structure of the
  nervous system. The circuits are there. But this is not the only way that our mental
  machinery can be used. That which has been learned can be unlearned. The first step is
  to realize what you are doing, as you are doing it, and stand back and quietly watch.
  
  From the Buddhist perspective, we humans have a backward view of life. We look at what
  is actually the cause of suffering and we see it as happiness. The cause of suffering is
  that desire-aversion syndrome which we spoke of earlier. Up pops a perception. It could
  be anything--a beautiful girl, a handsome guy, speed boat, thug with a gun, truck
  bearing down on you, anything. Whatever it is, the very next thing we do is to react to
  the stimulus with a feeling about it.
  
  Take worry. We worry a lot. Worry itself is the problem. Worry is a process. It has
  steps. Anxiety is not just a state of existence but a procedure. What you've got to do
  is to look at the very beginning of that procedure, those initial stages before the
  process has built up a head of steam. The very first link of the worry chain is the
  grasping/rejecting reaction. As soon as some phenomenon pops into the mind, we try
  mentally to grab onto it or push it away. That sets the worry response in
  motion. Luckily, there is a handy little tool called Vipassana meditation which you can
  use to short-circuit the whole mechanism.
  
  Vipassana meditation teaches us how to scrutinize our own perceptual process with great
  precision. We learn to watch the arising of thought and perception with a feeling of
  serene detachment. We learn to view our own reactions to stimuli with calm and
  clarity. We begin to see ourselves reacting without getting caught up in the reactions
  themselves. The obsessive nature of thought slowly dies. We can still get married. We
  can still step out of the path of the truck. But we don't need to go through hell over
  either one.
  
  This escape from the obsessive nature of thought produces a whole new view of
  reality. It is a complete paradigm shift, a total change in the perceptual mechanism. It
  brings with it the feeling of peace and rightness, a new zest for living and a sense of
  completeness to every activity. Because of these advantages, Buddhism views this way of
  looking at things as a correct view of life and Buddhist texts call it seeing things as
  they really are.
  
  Vipassana meditation is a set of training procedures which open us gradually to this new
  view of reality as it truly is. Along with this new reality goes a new view of the most
  central aspect of reality: 'me'. A close inspection reveals that we have done the same
  thing to 'me' that we have done to all other perceptions. We have taken a flowing vortex
  of thought, feeling and sensation and we have solidified that into a mental
  construct. Then we have stuck a label onto it, 'me'. And forever after, we treat it as
  if it were a static and enduring entity. We view it as a thing separate from all other
  things. We pinch ourselves off from the rest of that process of eternal change which is
  the universe. And then we grieve over how lonely we feel. We ignore our inherent
  connectedness to all other beings and we decide that 'I' have to get more for 'me'; then
  we marvel at how greedy and insensitive human beings are. And on it goes. Every evil
  deed, every example of heartlessness in the world stems directly from this false sense
  of 'me' as distinct from all else that is out there.
  
  Explode the illusion of that one concept and your whole universe changes. Don't expect
  to do this overnight, though. You spent your whole life building up that concept,
  reinforcing it with every thought, word, and deed over all those years. It is not going
  to evaporate instantly. But it will pass if you give it enough time and enough
  attention. Vipassana meditation is a process by which it is dissolved. Little by little,
  you chip away at it just by watching it.
  
  The 'I' concept is a process. It is a thing we are doing. In Vipassana we learn to see
  that we are doing it, when we are doing it and how we are doing it. Then it moves and
  fades away, like a cloud passing through the clear sky. We are left in a state where we
  can do it or not do it, whichever seems appropriate to the situation. The compulsiveness
  is gone. We have a choice.
  
  These are all major insights, of course. Each one is a deep-reaching understanding of
  one of the fundamental issues of human existence. They do not occur quickly, nor without
  considerable effort. But the payoff is big. They lead to a total transformation of your
  life. Every second of your existence thereafter is changed. The meditator who pushes all
  the way down this track achieves perfect mental health, a pure love for all that lives
  and complete cessation of suffering. That is not a small goal. But you don't have to go
  all the way to reap benefits. They start right away and they pile up over the years. It
  is a cumulative function. The more you sit, the more you learn about the real nature of
  your own existence. The more hours you spend in meditation, the greater your ability to
  calmly observe every impulse and intention, every thought and emotion just as it arises
  in the mind. Your progress to liberation is measured in cushion-man hours. And you can
  stop any time you've had enough. There is no stick over your head except your own desire
  to see the true quality of life, to enhance your own existence and that of others.
  
  Vipassana meditation is inherently experiential. It is not theoretical. In the practice
  of mediation you become sensitive to the actual experience of living, to how things
  feel. You do not sit around developing subtle and aesthetic thoughts about living. You
  live. Vipassana meditation more than anything else is learning to live.
* Chapter 4 - Attitude
  Within the last century, Western science and physics have made a startling discovery. We
  are part of the world we view. The very process of our observation changes the things we
  observe. As an example, an electron is an extremely tiny item. It cannot be viewed
  without instrumentation, and that apparatus dictates what the observer will see. If you
  look at an electron in one way, it appears to be a particle, a hard little ball that
  bounces around in nice straight paths. When you view it another way, an electron appears
  to be a wave form, with nothing solid about it. It glows and wiggles all over the
  place. An electron is an event more than a thing. And the observer participates in that
  event by the very process of his or her observation. There is no way to avoid this
  interaction.

  Eastern science has recognized this basic principle for a very long time. The mind is a
  set of events, and the observer participates in those events every time he or she looks
  inward. Meditation is participatory observation. What you are looking at responds to the
  process of looking. What you are looking at is you, and what you see depends on how you
  look. Thus the process of meditation is extremely delicate, and the result depends
  absolutely on the state of mind of the meditator. The following attitudes are essential
  to success in practice. Most of them have been presented before. But we bring them
  together again here as a series of rules for application.

  1. Don't expect anything. Just sit back and see what happens. Treat the whole thing as
     an experiment. Take an active interest in the test itself. But don't get distracted
     by your expectations about results. For that matter, don't be anxious for any result
     whatsoever. Let the meditation move along at its own speed and in its own
     direction. Let the meditation teach you what it wants you to learn. Meditative
     awareness seeks to see reality exactly as it is. Whether that corresponds to our
     expectations or not, it requires a temporary suspension of all our preconceptions and
     ideas. We must store away our images, opinions and interpretations someplace out of
     the way for the duration. Otherwise we will stumble over them.
  2. Don't strain: Don't force anything or make grand exaggerated efforts. Meditation is
     not aggressive. There is no violent striving. Just let your effort be relaxed and
     steady.
  3. Don't rush: There is no hurry, so take you time. Settle yourself on a cushion and sit
     as though you have a whole day. Anything really valuable takes time to
     develop. Patience, patience, patience.
  4. Don't cling to anything and don't reject anything: Let come what comes and
     accommodate yourself to that, whatever it is. If good mental images arise, that is
     fine. If bad mental images arise, that is fine, too. Look on all of it as equal and
     make yourself comfortable with whatever happens. Don't fight with what you
     experience, just observe it all mindfully.
  5. Let go: Learn to flow with all the changes that come up. Loosen up and relax.
  6. Accept everything that arises: Accept your feelings, even the ones you wish you did
     not have. Accept your experiences, even the ones you hate. Don't condemn yourself for
     having human flaws and failings. Learn to see all the phenomena in the mind as being
     perfectly natural and understandable. Try to exercise a disinterested acceptance at
     all times and with respect to everything you experience.
  7. Be gentle with yourself: Be kind to yourself. You may not be perfect, but you are all
     you've got to work with. The process of becoming who you will be begins first with
     the total acceptance of who you are.
  8. Investigate yourself: Question everything. Take nothing for granted. Don't believe
     anything because it sounds wise and pious and some holy men said it. See for
     yourself. That does not mean that you should be cynical, impudent or irreverent. It
     means you should be empirical. Subject all statements to the actual test of your
     experience and let the results be your guide to truth. Insight meditation evolves out
     of an inner longing to wake up to what is real and to gain liberating insight to the
     true structure of existence. The entire practice hinges upon this desire to be awake
     to the truth. Without it, the practice is superficial.
  9. View all problems as challenges: Look upon negatives that arise as opportunities to
     learn and to grow. Don't run from them, condemn yourself or bear your burden in
     saintly silence. You have a problem? Great. More grist for the mill. Rejoice, dive in
     and investigate.
  10. Don't ponder: You don't need to figure everything out. Discursive thinking won't
      free you from the trap. In mediation, the mind is purified naturally by mindfulness,
      by wordless bare attention. Habitual deliberation is not necessary to eliminate
      those things that are keeping you in bondage. All that is necessary is a clear,
      non-conceptual perception of what they are and how they work. That alone is
      sufficient to dissolve them. Concepts and reasoning just get in the way. Don't
      think. See.
  11. Don't dwell upon contrasts: Differences do exist between people, but dwelling upon
      them is a dangerous process. Unless carefully handled, it leads directly to
      egotism. Ordinary human thinking is full of greed, jealousy and pride. A man seeing
      another man on the street may immediately think, "He is better looking than I am."
      The instant result is envy or shame. A girl seeing another girl may think, "I am
      prettier than she is." The instant result is pride. This sort of comparison is a
      mental habit, and it leads directly to ill feeling of one sort or another: greed,
      envy, pride, jealousy, hatred. It is an unskillful mental state, but we do it all
      the time. We compare our looks with others, our success, our accomplishments, our
      wealth, possessions, or our I.Q. and all these lead to the same place--estrangement,
      barriers between people, and ill feeling.

  The meditator's job is to cancel this unskillful habit by examining it thoroughly, and
  then replacing it with another. Rather than noticing the differences between self and
  others, the meditator trains himself to notice similarities. He centers his attention on
  those factors that are universal to all life, things that will move him closer to
  others. Thus his comparison, if any, leads to feelings of kinship rather than feelings
  of estrangement. Breathing is a universal process. All vertebrates breathe in
  essentially the same manner. All living things exchange gasses with their environment in
  some way or other. This is one of the reasons that breathing is chosen as the focus of
  meditation. The meditator is advised to explore the process of his own breathing as a
  vehicle for realizing his own inherent connectedness with the rest of life. This does
  not mean that we shut our eyes to all the differences around us. Differences exist. It
  means simply that we de-emphasize contrasts and emphasize the universal factors. The
  recommended procedure is as follows:

  When the meditator perceives any sensory object, he is not to dwell upon it in the
  ordinary egotistical way. He should rather examine the very process of perception
  itself. He should watch the feelings that arise and the mental activities that
  follow. He should note the changes that occur in his own consciousness as a result. In
  watching all these phenomena, the meditator must be aware of the universality of what he
  is seeing. That initial perception will spark pleasant, unpleasant or neutral
  feelings. That is a universal phenomenon. It occurs in the mind of others just as it
  does in his, and he should see that clearly. Following these feelings various reactions
  may arise. He may feel greed, lust, or jealousy. He may feel fear, worry, restlessness
  or boredom. These reactions are universal. He simple notes them and then generalizes. He
  should realize that these reactions are normal human responses and can arise in anybody.
  
  The practice of this style of comparison may feel forced and artificial at first, but it
  is no less natural than what we ordinarily do. It is merely unfamiliar. With practice,
  this habit pattern replaces our normal habit of egoistic comparing and feels far more
  natural in the long run. We become very understanding people as a result. We no longer
  get upset by the failings of others. We progress toward harmony with all life.
* Chapter 5 - The Practice
  Although there are many subjects of meditation, we strongly recommend you start with
  focusing your total undivided attention on your breathing to gain some degree of shallow
  concentration. Remember that you are not practicing a deep absorption or pure
  concentration technique. You are practicing mindfulness for which you need only a
  certain degree of shallow concentration. You want to cultivate mindfulness culminating
  in insight and wisdom to realize the truth as it is. You want to know the working of
  your body-mind complex exactly as it is. You want to get rid of all psychological
  annoyance to make your life really peaceful and happy. The mind cannot be purified
  without seeing things as they really are. "Seeing things as they really are" is such a
  heavily loaded and ambiguous phrase. Many beginning meditators wonder what we mean, for
  anyone who has clear eye sight can see objects as they are.

  When we use this phrase in reference to insight gained from our meditation, what we mean
  is not seeing things superficially with our regular eyes, but seeing things with wisdom
  as they are in themselves. Seeing with wisdom means seeing things within the framework
  of our body/mind complex without prejudices or biases springing from our greed, hatred
  and delusion. Ordinarily when we watch the working of our mind/body complex, we tend to
  hide or ignore things which are not pleasant to us and to hold onto things which are
  pleasant. This is because our minds are generally influenced by our desires, resentment
  and delusion. Our ego, self or opinions get in our way and color our judgment.

  When we mindfully watch our bodily sensations, we should not confuse them with mental
  formations, for bodily sensations can arise without anything to do with the mind. For
  instance, we sit comfortably. After a while, there can arise some uncomfortable feeling
  on our back or in our legs. Our mind immediately experiences that discomfort and forms
  numerous thoughts around the feeling. At that point, without trying to confuse the
  feeling with the mental formations, we should isolate the feeling as feeling and watch
  it mindfully. Feeling is one of the seven universal mental factors. The other six are
  contact, perception, mental formations, concentration, life force, and awareness.

  At another time, we may have a certain emotion such as, resentment, fear, or lust. Then
  we should watch the emotion exactly as it is without trying to confuse it with anything
  else. When we bundle our form, feeling, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness
  up into one and try to watch all of them as feeling, we get confused, as we will not be
  able to see the source of feeling. If we simply dwell upon the feeling alone, ignoring
  other mental factors, our realization of truth becomes very difficult. We want to gain
  the insight into the experience of impermanence to over come our resentment; our deeper
  knowledge of unhappiness overcomes our greed which causes our unhappiness; our
  realization of selflessness overcomes ignorance arising from the notion of self. We
  should see the mind and body separately first. Having comprehended them separately, we
  should see their essential interconnectedness. As our insight becomes sharp, we become
  more and more aware of the fact that all the aggregates are cooperating to work
  together. None can exist without the other. We can see the real meaning of the famous
  metaphor of the blind man who has a healthy body to walk and the disabled person who has
  very good eyes to see. Neither of them alone can do much for himself. But when the
  disabled person climbs on the shoulders of the blind man, together they can travel and
  achieve their goals easily. Similarly, the body alone can do nothing for itself. It is
  like a log unable to move or do anything by itself except to become a subject of
  impermanence, decay and death. The mind itself can do nothing without the support of the
  body. When we mindfully watch both body and mind, we can see how many wonderful things
  they do together.

  As long as we are sitting in one place we may gain some degree of mindfulness. Going to
  a retreat and spending several days or several months watching our feelings,
  perceptions, countless thoughts and various states of consciousness may make us
  eventually calm and peaceful. Normally we do not have that much time to spend in one
  place meditating all the time. Therefore, we should find a way to apply our mindfulness
  to our daily life in order for us to be able to handle daily unforeseeable
  eventualities. What we face every day is unpredictable. Things happen due to multiple
  causes and conditions, as we are living in a conditional and impermanent
  world. Mindfulness is our emergency kit, readily available at our service at any
  time. When we face a situation where we feel indignation, if we mindfully investigate
  our own mind, we will discover bitter truths in ourselves. That is we are selfish; we
  are egocentric; we are attached to our ego; we hold on to our opinions; we think we are
  right and everybody else is wrong; we are prejudiced; we are biased; and at the bottom
  of all of this, we do not really love ourselves. This discovery, though bitter, is a
  most rewarding experience. And in the long run, this discovery delivers us from deeply
  rooted psychological and spiritual suffering.

  Mindfulness practice is the practice of one hundred percent honesty with ourselves. When
  we watch our own mind and body, we notice certain things that are unpleasant to
  realize. As we do not like them, we try to reject them. What are the things we do not
  like? We do not like to detach ourselves from loved ones or to live with unloved
  ones. We include not only people, places and material things into our likes and
  dislikes, but opinions, ideas, beliefs and decisions as well. We do not like what
  naturally happens to us. We do not like, for instance, growing old, becoming sick,
  becoming weak or showing our age, for we have a great desire to preserve our
  appearance. We do not like someone pointing out our faults, for we take great pride in
  ourselves. We do not like someone to be wiser than we are, for we are deluded about
  ourselves. These are but a few examples of our personal experience of greed, hatred and
  ignorance.

  When greed, hatred and ignorance reveal themselves in our daily lives, we use our
  mindfulness to track them down and comprehend their roots. The root of each of these
  mental states is within ourselves. If we do not, for instance, have the root of hatred,
  nobody can make us angry, for it is the root of our anger that reacts to somebody's
  actions or words or behavior. If we are mindful, we will diligently use our wisdom to
  look into our own mind. If we do not have hatred in us we will not be concerned when
  someone points out our shortcomings. Rather, we will be thankful to the person who draws
  our attention to our faults. We have to be extremely wise and mindful to thank the
  person who explicates our faults so we will be able to tread the upward path toward
  improving ourselves. We all have blind spots. The other person is our mirror for us to
  see our faults with wisdom. We should consider the person who shows our shortcomings as
  one who excavates a hidden treasure in us that we were unaware of. It is by knowing the
  existence of our deficiencies that we can improve ourselves. Improving ourselves is the
  unswerving path to the perfection which is our goal in life. Only by overcoming
  weaknesses can we cultivate noble qualities hidden deep down in our subconscious
  mind. Before we try to surmount our defects, we should know what they are.

  If we are sick, we must find out the cause of our sickness. Only then can we get
  treatment. If we pretend that we do not have sickness even though we are suffering, we
  will never get treatment. Similarly, if we think that we don't have these faults, we
  will never clear our spiritual path. If we are blind to our own flaws, we need someone
  to point them out to us. When they point out our faults, we should be grateful to them
  like the Venerable Sariputta, who said: "Even if a seven-year-old novice monk points out
  my mistakes, I will accept them with utmost respect for him." Ven. Sariputta was an
  Arahant who was one hundred percent mindful and had no fault in him. But since he did
  not have any pride, he was able to maintain this position. Although we are not Arahants,
  we should determine to emulate his example, for our goal in life also is to attain what
  he attained.

  Of course the person pointing out our mistakes himself may not be totally free from
  defects, but he can see our problems as we can see his faults, which he does not notice
  until we point them out to him.

  Both pointing out shortcomings and responding to them should be done mindfully. If
  someone becomes unmindful in indicating faults and uses unkind and harsh language, he
  might do more harm than good to himself as well as to the person whose shortcomings he
  points out. One who speaks with resentment cannot be mindful and is unable to express
  himself clearly. One who feels hurt while listening to harsh language may lose his
  mindfulness and not hear what the other person is really saying. We should speak
  mindfully and listen mindfully to be benefitted by talking and listening. When we listen
  and talk mindfully, our minds are free from greed, selfishness, hatred and delusion.

** Our Goal

   As meditators, we all must have a goal, for if we do not have a goal, we will simply be
   groping in the dark blindly following somebody's instructions on meditation. There must
   certainly be a goal for whatever we do consciously and willingly. It is not the
   Vipassana meditator's goal to become enlightened before other people or to have more
   power or to make more profit than others, for mindfulness meditators are not in
   competition with each other.

   Our goal is to reach the perfection of all the noble and wholesome qualities latent in
   our subconscious mind. This goal has five elements to it: Purification of mind,
   overcoming sorrow and lamentation, overcoming pain and grief, treading the right path
   leading to attainment of eternal peace, and attaining happiness by following that
   path. Keeping this fivefold goal in mind, we can advance with hope and confidence to
   reach the goal.

** Practice

   Once you sit, do not change the position again until the end of the time you determined
   at the beginning. Suppose you change your original position because it is
   uncomfortable, and assume another position. What happens after a while is that the new
   position becomes uncomfortable. Then you want another and after a while, it too becomes
   uncomfortable. So you may go on shifting, moving, changing one position to another the
   whole time you are on your mediation cushion and you may not gain a deep and meaningful
   level of concentration. Therefore, do not change your original position, no matter how
   painful it is.

   To avoid changing your position, determine at the beginning of meditation how long you
   are going to meditate. If you have never meditated before, sit motionless not longer
   than twenty minutes. As you repeat your practice, you can increase your sitting
   time. The length of sitting depends on how much time you have for sitting meditation
   practice and how long you can sit without excruciating pain.

   We should not have a time schedule to attain the goal, for our attainment depends on
   how we progress in our practice based on our understanding and development of our
   spiritual faculties. We must work diligently and mindfully towards the goal without
   setting any particular time schedule to reach it. When we are ready, we get there. All
   we have to do is to prepare ourselves for that attainment.

   After sitting motionless, close your eyes. Our mind is analogous to a cup of muddy
   water. The longer you keep a cup of muddy water still, the more mud settles down and
   the water will be seen clearly. Similarly, if you keep quiet without moving your body,
   focusing your entire undivided attention on the subject of your meditation, your mind
   settles down and begins to experience the bliss of meditation.

   To prepare for this attainment, we should keep our mind in the present moment. The
   present moment is changing so fast that the casual observer does not seem to notice its
   existence at all. Every moment is a moment of events and no moment passes by without
   noticing events taking place in that moment. Therefore, the moment we try to pay bare
   attention to is the present moment. Our mind goes through a series of events like a
   series of pictures passing through a projector. Some of these pictures are coming from
   our past experiences and others are our imaginations of things that we plan to do in
   the future.

   The mind can never be focused without a mental object. Therefore we must give our mind
   an object which is readily available every present moment. What is present every moment
   is our breath. The mind does not have to make a great effort to find the breath, for
   every moment the breath is flowing in and out through our nostrils. As our practice of
   insight meditation is taking place every waking moment, our mind finds it very easy to
   focus itself on the breath, for it is more conspicuous and constant than any other
   object.

   After sitting in the manner explained earlier and having shared your loving-kindness
   with everybody, take three deep breaths. After taking three deep breaths, breathe
   normally, letting your breath flow in and out freely, effortlessly and begin focusing
   your attention on the rims of your nostrils. Simply notice the feeling of breath going
   in and out. When one inhalation is complete and before exhaling begins, there is a
   brief pause. Notice it and notice the beginning of exhaling. When the exhalation is
   complete, there is another brief pause before inhaling begins. Notice this brief pause,
   too. This means that there are two brief pauses of breath--one at the end of inhaling,
   and the other at the end of exhaling. The two pauses occur in such a brief moment you
   may not be aware of their occurrence. But when you are mindful, you can notice them.

   Do not verbalize or conceptualize anything. Simply notice the in-coming and out-going
   breath without saying, "I breathe in", or "I breathe out." When you focus your
   attention on the breath ignore any thought, memory, sound, smell, taste, etc., and
   focus your attention exclusively on the breath, nothing else.

   At the beginning, both the inhalations and exhalations are short because the body and
   mind are not calm and relaxed. Notice the feeling of that short inhaling and short
   exhaling as they occur without saying "short inhaling" or "short exhaling". As you
   remain noticing the felling of short inhaling and short exhaling, your body and mind
   become relatively calm. Then your breath becomes long. Notice the feeling of that long
   breath as it is without saying "Long breath". Then notice the entire breathing process
   from the beginning to the end. Subsequently the breath becomes subtle, and the mind and
   body become calmer than before. Notice this calm and peaceful feeling of your
   breathing.

** What To Do When the Mind Wanders Away?

   In spite of your concerted effort to keep the mind on your breathing, the mind may
   wander away. It may go to past experiences and suddenly you may find yourself
   remembering places you've visited, people you met, friends not seen for a long time, a
   book you read long ago, the taste of food you ate yesterday, and so on. As soon as you
   notice that your mind is no longer on your breath, mindfully bring it back to it and
   anchor it there. However, in a few moments you may be caught up again thinking how to
   pay your bills, to make a telephone call to your friend, write a letter to someone, do
   your laundry, buy your groceries, go to a party, plan your next vacation, and so
   forth. As soon as you notice that your mind is not on your subject, bring it back
   mindfully. Following are some suggestions to help you gain the concentration necessary
   for the practice of mindfulness.

*** 1. Counting

     In a situation like this, counting may help. The purpose of counting is simply to
     focus the mind on the breath. Once your mind is focused on the breath, give up
     counting. This is a device for gaining concentration. There are numerous ways of
     counting. Any counting should be done mentally. Do not make any sound when you
     count. Following are some of the ways of counting.

     a) While breathing in count "one, one, one, one..." until the lungs are full of fresh
     air. While breathing out count "two, two, two, two..." until the lings are empty of
     fresh air. Then while breathing in again count "three, three, three, three..." until
     the lungs are full again and while breathing out count again "four, four, four,
     four..." until the lungs are empty of fresh air. Count up to ten and repeat as many
     times as necessary to keep the mind focused on the breath.

     b) The second method of counting is counting rapidly up to ten. While counting "one,
     two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten" breathe in and again while
     counting "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten" breathe
     out. This means in one inhaling you should count up to ten and in one exhaling you
     should count up to ten. Repeat this way of counting as many times as necessary to
     focus the mind on the breath.
     
     c) The third method of counting is counting in succession up to ten. At this time
     count "one, two, three, four, five" (only up to five) while inhaling and then count
     "one, two, three, four, five, six" (up to six) while exhaling. Again count "one, two,
     three, four fire, six seven" (only up to seven) while inhaling. Then count "one, two,
     three, four, five, six, seven, eight" while exhaling. Count up to nine while inhaling
     and count up to ten while exhaling. Repeat this way of counting as many times as
     necessary to focus the mind on the breath.
     
     d) The fourth method is to take a long breath. When the lungs are full, mentally
     count "one" and breathe out completely until the lungs are empty of fresh air. Then
     count mentally "two". Take a long breath again and count "three" and breathe
     completely out as before. When the lungs are empty of fresh air, count mentally
     "four". Count your breath in this manner up to ten. Then count backward from ten to
     one. Count again from one to ten and then ten to one.
     
     e) The fifth method is to join inhaling and exhaling. When the lungs are empty of
     fresh air, count mentally "one". This time you should count both inhalation and
     exhalation as one. Again inhale, exhale, and mentally count "two". This way of
     counting should be done only up to five and repeated from five to one. Repeat this
     method until your breathing becomes refined and quiet.

     Remember that you are not supposed to continue your counting all the time. As soon as
     your mind is locked at the nostrils-tip where the inhaling breath and exhaling breath
     touch and begin to feel that your breathing is so refined and quiet that you cannot
     notice inhalation and exhalation separately, you should give up counting. Counting is
     used only to train the mind to concentrate on one point.

*** 2. Connecting

    After inhaling do not wait to notice the brief pause before exhaling but connect the
    inhaling and exhaling, so you can notice both inhaling and exhaling as one continuous
    breath.

*** 3. Fixing

    After joining inhaling and exhaling, fix your mind on the point where you feel you
    inhaling and exhaling breath touching. Inhale and exhale as on single breath moving in
    and out touching or rubbing the rims of your nostrils.

*** 4. Focus you mind like a carpenter

    A carpenter draws a straight line on a board that he wants to cut. Then he cuts the
    board with his handsaw along the straight line he drew. He does not look at the teeth
    of his saw as they move in and out of the board. Rather he focuses his entire
    attention on the line he drew so he can cut the board straight. Similarly keep your
    mind straight on the point where you feel the breath at the rims of your nostrils.

*** 5. Make you mind like a gate-keeper

    A gate-keeper does not take into account any detail of the people entering a
    house. All he does is notice people entering the house and leaving the house through
    the gate. Similarly, when you concentrate you should not take into account any detail
    of your experiences. Simply notice the feeling of your inhaling and exhaling breath as
    it goes in and out right at the rims of your nostrils.

    As you continue your practice your mind and body becomes so light that you may feel as
    if you are floating in the air or on water. You may even feel that your body is
    springing up into the sky. When the grossness of your in-and-out breathing has ceased,
    subtle in-and-out breathing arises. This very subtle breath is your objective focus of
    the mind. This is the sign of concentration. This first appearance of a sign-object
    will be replaced by more and more subtle sign-object. This subtlety of the sign can be
    compared to the sound of a bell. When a bell is struck with a big iron rod, you hear a
    gross sound at first. As the sound fades away, the sound becomes very
    subtle. Similarly the in-and-out breath appears at first as a gross sign. As you keep
    paying bare attention to it, this sign becomes very subtle. But the consciousness
    remains totally focused on the rims of the nostrils. Other meditation objects become
    clearer and clearer, as the sign develops. But the breath becomes subtler and subtler
    as the sign develops. Because of this subtlety, you may not notice the presence of
    your breath. Don't get disappointed thinking that you lost your breath or that nothing
    is happening to your meditation practice. Don't worry. Be mindful and determined to
    bring your feeling of breath back to the rims of your nostrils. This is the time you
    should practice more vigorously, balancing your energy, faith, mindfulness,
    concentration and wisdom.

** Farmer's simile

   Suppose there is a farmer who uses buffaloes for plowing his rice field. As he is tired
   in the middle of the day, he unfastens his buffaloes and takes a rest under the cool
   shade of a tree. When he wakes up, he does not find his animals. He does not worry, but
   simply walks to the water place where all the animals gather for drinking in the hot
   mid-day and he finds his buffaloes there. Without any problem he brings them back and
   ties them to the yoke again and starts plowing his field.
   
   Similarly as you continue this exercise, your breath becomes so subtle and refined that
   you might not be able to notice the feeling of breath at all. When this happens, do not
   worry. It has not disappeared. It is still where it was before-right at the
   nostril-tips. Take a few quick breaths and you will notice the feeling of breathing
   again. Continue to pay bare attention to the feeling of the touch of breath at the rims
   of your nostrils.
   
   As you keep your mind focused on the rims of your nostrils, you will be able to notice
   the sign of the development of meditation. You will feel the pleasant sensation of
   sign. Different meditators feel this differently. It will be like a star, or a peg made
   of heartwood, or a long string, or a wreath of flowers, or a puff of smoke, or a
   cob-web, or a film of cloud, or a lotus flower, or the disc of the moon or the disc of
   the sun.
   
   Earlier in your practice you had inhaling and exhaling as objects of meditation. Now
   you have the sign as the third object of meditation. When you focus your mind on this
   third object, your mind reaches a stage of concentration sufficient for your practice
   of insight meditation. This sign is strongly present at the rims of the
   nostrils. Master it and gain full control of it so that whenever you want, it should be
   available. Unite the mind with this sign which is available in the present moment and
   let the mind flow with every succeeding moment. As you pay bare attention to it, you
   will see the sign itself is changing every moment. Keep your mind with the changing
   moments. Also notice that your mind can be concentrated only on the present
   moment. This unity of the mind with the present moment is called momentary
   concentration. As moments are incessantly passing away one after another, the mind
   keeps pace with them. Changing with them, appearing and disappearing with them without
   clinging to any of them. If we try to stop the mind at one moment, we end up in
   frustration because the mind cannot be held fast. It must keep up with what is
   happening in the new moment. As the present moment can be found any moment, every
   waking moment can be made a concentrated moment.
   
   To unite the mind with the present moment, we must find something happening in that
   moment. However, you cannot focus your mind on every changing moment without a certain
   degree of concentration to keep pace with the moment. Once you gain this degree of
   concentration, you can use it for focusing your attention on anything you
   experience--the rising and falling of your abdomen, the rising and falling of the chest
   area, the rising and falling of any feeling, or the rising and falling of your breath
   or thoughts and so on.
   
   To make any progress in insight meditation you need this kind of momentary
   concentration. That is all you need for the insight meditation practice because
   everything in your experience lives only for one moment. When you focus this
   concentrated state of mind on the changes taking place in your mind and body, you will
   notice that your breath is the physical part and the feeling of breath, consciousness
   of the feeling and the consciousness of the sign are the mental parts. As you notice
   them you can notice that they are changing all the time. You may have various types of
   sensations, other than the feeling of breathing, taking place in your body. Watch them
   all over your body. Don't try to create any feeling which is not naturally present in
   any part of your body. When thought arises notice it, too. All you should notice in all
   these occurrences is the impermanent, unsatisfactory and selfless nature of all your
   experiences whether mental or physical.
   
   As your mindfulness develops, your resentment for the change, your dislike for the
   unpleasant experiences, your greed for the pleasant experiences and the notion of
   self-hood will be replaced by the deeper insight of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness
   and selflessness. This knowledge of reality in your experience helps you to foster a
   more calm, peaceful and mature attitude towards your life. You will see what you
   thought in the past to be permanent is changing with such an inconceivable rapidity
   that even your mind cannot keep up with these changes. Somehow you will be able to
   notice many of the changes. You will see the subtlety of impermanence and the subtlety
   of selflessness. This insight will show you the way to peace, happiness and give you
   the wisdom to handle your daily problems in life.
   
   When the mind is united with the breath flowing all the time, we will naturally be able
   to focus the mind on the present moment. We can notice the feeling arising from contact
   of breath with the rim of our nostrils. As the earth element of the air that we breathe
   in and out touches the earth element of our nostrils, the mind feels the flow of air in
   and out. The warm feeling arises at the nostrils or any other part of the body from the
   contact of the heat element generated by the breathing process. The feeling of
   impermanence of breath arises when the earth element of flowing breath touches the
   nostrils. Although the water element is present in the breath, the mind cannot feel it.
   
   Also we feel the expansion and contraction of our lungs, abdomen and low abdomen, as
   the fresh air is pumped in and out of the lungs. The expansion and contraction of the
   abdomen, lower abdomen and chest are parts of the universal rhythm. Everything in the
   universe has the same rhythm of expansion and contraction just like our breath and
   body. All of them are rising and falling. However, our primary concern is the rising
   and falling phenomena of the breath and minute parts of our minds and bodies.
   
   Along with the inhaling breath, we experience a small degree of calmness. This little
   degree of tension-free calmness turns into tension if we don't breathe out in a few
   moments. As we breathe out this tension is released. After breathing out, we experience
   discomfort if we wait too long before having fresh brought in again. This means that
   every time our lungs are full we must breathe out and every time our lungs are empty we
   must breathe in. As we breathe in, we experience a small degree of calmness, and as we
   breathe out, we experience a small degree of calmness. We desire calmness and relief of
   tension and do not like the tension and feeling resulting from the lack of breath. We
   wish that the calmness would stay longer and the tension disappear more quickly that it
   normally does. But neither will the tension go away as fast as we wish nor the calmness
   stay as long as we wish. And again we get agitated or irritated, for we desire the
   calmness to return and stay longer and the tension to go away quickly and not to return
   again. Here we see how even a small degree of desire for permanency in an impermanent
   situation causes pain or unhappiness. Since there is no self-entity to control this
   situation, we will become more disappointed.
   
   However, if we watch our breathing without desiring calmness and without resenting
   tension arising from the breathing in and out, but experience only the impermanence,
   the unsatisfactoriness and selflessness of our breath, our mind becomes peaceful and
   calm.
   
   Also, the mind does not stay all the time with the feeling of breath. It goes to
   sounds, memories, emotions, perceptions, consciousness and mental formations as
   well. When we experience these states, we should forget about the feeling of breath and
   immediately focus our attention on these states--one at a time, not all of them at one
   time. As they fade away, we let our mind return to the breath which is the home base
   the mind can return to from quick or long journeys to various states of mind and
   body. We must remember that all these mental journeys are made within the mind itself.
   
   Every time the mind returns to the breath, it comes back with a deeper insight into
   impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and selflessness. The mind becomes more insightful
   from the impartial and unbiased watching of these occurrences. The mind gains insight
   into the fact that this body, these feelings, various states of consciousness and
   numerous mental formations are to be used only for the purpose of gaining deeper
   insight into the reality of this mind/body complex.
* Chapter 6 - What To Do With Your Body
  The practice of meditation has been going on for several thousand years. That is quite a
  bit of time for experimentation, and the procedure has been very, very thoroughly
  refined. Buddhist practice has always recognized that the mind and body are tightly
  linked and that each influences the other. Thus there are certain recommended physical
  practices which will greatly assist you to master your skill. And these practices should
  be followed. Keep in mind, however, that these postures are practice aids. Don't confuse
  the two. Meditation does not mean sitting in the lotus position. It is a mental
  skill. It can be practiced anywhere you wish. But these postures will help you learn
  this skill and they speed your progress and development. So use them.

** General Rules

   The purpose of the various postures is threefold. First, they provide a stable feeling
   in the body. This allows you to remove your attention from such issues as balance and
   muscular fatigue, so that you can then center your concentration upon the formal object
   of meditation. Second, they promote physical immobility which is then reflected by an
   immobility of mind. This creates a deeply settled and tranquil concentration. Third,
   they give you the ability to sit for a long period of time without yielding to the
   meditator's three main enemies--pain, muscular tension and falling asleep. The most
   essential thing is to sit with your back straight. The spine should be erect with the
   spinal vertebrae held like a stack of coins, one on top of the other. Your head should
   be held in line with the rest of the spine. All of this is done in a relaxed manner. No
   Stiffness. You are not a wooden soldier, and there is no drill sergeant. There should
   be no muscular tension involved in keeping the back straight. Sit light and easy. The
   spine should be like a firm young tree growing out of soft ground. The rest of the body
   just hangs from it in a loose, relaxed manner. This is going to require a bit of
   experimentation on your part. We generally sit in tight, guarded postures when we are
   walking or talking and in sprawling postures when we are relaxing. Neither of those
   will do. But they are cultural habits and they can be re-learned. Your objective is to
   achieve a posture in which you can sit for the entire session without moving at all. In
   the beginning, you will probably feel a bit odd to sit with the straight back. But you
   will get used to it. It takes practice, and an erect posture is very important. This is
   what is known in physiology as a position of arousal, and with it goes mental
   alertness. If you slouch, you are inviting drowsiness. What you sit on is equally
   important. You are going to need a chair or a cushion, depending on the posture you
   choose, and the firmness of the seat must be chosen with some care. Too soft a seat can
   put you right to sleep. Too hard can promote pain.

** Clothing

   The clothes you wear for meditation should be loose and soft. If they restrict blood
   flow or put pressure on nerves, the result will be pain and/or that tingling numbness
   which we normally refer to as our 'legs going to sleep'. If you are wearing a belt,
   loosen it. Don't wear tight pants or pants made of thick material. Long skirts are a
   good choice for women. Loose pants made of thin or elastic material are fine for
   anybody. Soft, flowing robes are the traditional garb in Asia and they come in an
   enormous variety of styles such as sarongs and kimonos. Take your shoes off and if your
   stockings are thick and binding, take them off, too.

** Traditional Postures

   When you are sitting on the floor in the traditional Asian manner, you need a cushion
   to elevate your spine. Choose one that is relatively firm and at least three inches
   thick when compressed. Sit close to the front edge of the cushion and let your crossed
   legs rest on the floor in front of you. If the floor is carpeted, that may be enough to
   protect your shins and ankles from pressure. If it is not, you will probably need some
   sort of padding for your legs. A folded blanket will do nicely. Don't sit all the way
   back on the cushion. This position causes its front edge to press into the underside of
   your thigh, causing nerves to pinch. The result will be leg pain.

   There are a number of ways you can fold your legs. We will list four in ascending order
   of preference.

   1. American indian style. Your right foot is tucked under the left knee and left foot
      is tucked under your right knee.
   2. Burmese style. Both of your legs lie flat on the floor from knee to foot. They are
      parallel with each other and one in front of the other.
   3. Half lotus. Both knees touch the floor. One leg and foot lie flat along the calf of
      the other leg.
   4. Full lotus. Both knees touch the floor, and your legs are crossed at the calf. Your
      left foot rests on the right thigh, and your right foot rests on the left
      thigh. Both soles turn upward.

   In these postures, your hands are cupped one on the other, and they rest on your lap
   with the palms turned upward. The hands lie just below the navel with the bend of each
   wrist pressed against the thigh. This arm position provides firm bracing for the upper
   body. Don't tighten your neck muscles. Relax your arms. Your diaphragm is held relaxed,
   expanded to maximum fullness. Don't let tension build up in the stomach area. Your chin
   is up. Your eyes can be open or closed. If you keep them open, fix them on the tip of
   your nose or in the middle distance straight in front. You are not looking at
   anything. You are just putting your eyes in some arbitrary direction where there is
   nothing in particular to see, so that you can forget about vision. Don't strain. Don't
   stiffen and don't be rigid. Relax; let the body be natural and supple. Let it hang from
   the erect spine like a rag doll.

   Half and full lotus positions are the traditional meditation postures in asia. And the
   full lotus is considered the best. It is the most solid by far. Once you are locked
   into this position, you can be completely immovable for a very long period. Since it
   requires a considerable flexibility in the legs, not everybody can do it. Besides, the
   main criterion by which you choose a posture for yourself is not what others say about
   it. It is your own comfort. Choose a position which allows you to sit the longest
   without pain, without moving. Experiment with different postures. The tendons will
   loosen with practice. And then you can work gradually towards the full lotus.

** Using A Chair

   Sitting on the floor may not be feasible for you because of pain or some other
   reason. No problem. You can always use a chair instead. Pick one that has a level seat,
   a straight back and no arms. It is best to sit in such a way that your back does not
   lean against the back of the chair. The front of the seat should not dig into the
   underside of your thighs. Place your legs side by side,feet flat on the floor. As with
   the traditional postures, place both hands on your lap, cupped one upon the
   other. Don't tighten your neck or shoulder muscles, and relax your arms. Your eyes can
   be open or closed.

   In all the above postures, remember your objectives. You want to achieve a state of
   complete physical stillness, yet you don't want to fall asleep. Recall the analogy of
   the muddy water. You want to promote a totally settled state of the body which will
   engender a corresponding mental settling. There must also be a state of physical
   alertness which can induce the kind of mental clarity you seek. So experiment. Your
   body is a tool for creating desired mental states. Use it judiciously.
* Chapter 7 - What To Do With Your Mind
  The meditation we teach is called Insight Meditation. As we have already said, the
  variety of possible objects of meditation is nearly unlimited, and human beings have
  used an enormous number down through the ages. Even within the Vipassana tradition there
  are variances. There are meditation teachers who teach their students to follow the
  breath by watching the rise and fall of the abdomen. Others recommend focusing attention
  on the touch of the body against the cushion, or hand against hand, or the feeling of
  one leg against the other. The method we are explaining here, however, is considered the
  most traditional and is probably what Gotama Buddha taught his students. The
  Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha's original discourse on mindfulness, specifically says
  that one must begin by focusing the attention on the breathing and then go on to note
  all other physical and mental phenomena which arise.
  
  We sit, watching the air going in and out of our noses. At first glance, this seems an
  exceedingly odd and useless procedure. Before going on to specific instructions, let us
  examine the reason behind it. The first question we might address is why use any focus
  of attention at all? We are, after all, trying to develop awareness. Why not just sit
  down and be aware of whatever happens to be present in the mind? In fact there are
  meditations of that nature. They are sometimes referred to as unstructured meditation
  and they are quite difficult. The mind is tricky. Thought is an inherently complicated
  procedure. By that we mean we become trapped, wrapped up, and stuck in the thought
  chain. One thought leads to another which leads to another, and another, and another,
  and so on. Fifteen minutes later we suddenly wake up and realize we spent that whole
  time stuck in a daydream or sexual fantasy or a set of worries about our bills or
  whatever.
  
  There is a difference between being aware of a thought and thinking a thought. That
  difference is very subtle. It is primarily a matter of feeling or texture. A thought you
  are simply aware of with bare attention feels light in texture; there is a sense of
  distance between that thought and the awareness viewing it. It arises lightly like a
  bubble, and it passes away without necessarily giving rise to the next thought in that
  chain. Normal conscious thought is much heavier in texture. It is ponderous, commanding,
  and compulsive. It sucks you in and grabs control of consciousness. By its very nature
  it is obsessional, and it leads straight to the next thought in the chain, apparently
  with no gap between them.
  
  Conscious thought sets up a corresponding tension in the body, such as muscular
  contraction or a quickening of the heartbeat. But you won't feel tension until it grows
  to actual pain, because normal conscious thought is also greedy. It grabs all your
  attention and leaves none to notice its own effect. The difference between being aware
  of the thought and thinking the thought is very real. But it is extremely subtle and
  difficult to see. Concentration is one of the tools needed to be able to see this
  difference.
  
  Deep concentration has the effect of slowing down the thought process and speeding up
  the awareness viewing it. The result is the enhanced ability to examine the thought
  process. Concentration is our microscope for viewing subtle internal states. We use the
  focus of attention to achieve one-pointedness of mind with calm and constantly applied
  attention. Without a fixed reference point you get lost, overcome by the ceaseless waves
  of change flowing round and round within the mind.
  
  We use breath as our focus. It serves as that vital reference point from which the mind
  wanders and is drawn back. Distraction cannot be seen as distraction unless there is
  some central focus to be distracted from. That is the frame of reference against which
  we can view the incessant changes and interruptions that go on all the time as a part of
  normal thinking.
  
  Ancient Pali texts liken meditation to the process of taming a wild elephant. The
  procedure in those days was to tie a newly captured animal to a post with a good strong
  rope. When you do this the elephant is not happy. He screams and tramples, and pulls
  against the rope for days. Finally it sinks through his skull that he can't get away,
  and he settles down. At this point you can begin to feed him and to handle him with some
  measure of safety. Eventually you can dispense with the rope and post altogether, and
  train your elephant for various tasks. Now you've got a tamed elephant that can be put
  to useful work. In this analogy the wild elephant is your wildly active mind, the rope
  is mindfulness, and the post is our object of meditation-- breathing. The tamed elephant
  who emerges from this process is a well trained, concentrated mind that can then be used
  for the exceedingly tough job of piercing the layers of illusion that obscure
  reality. Meditation tames the mind.
  
  The next question we need to address is: Why choose breathing as the primary object of
  meditation? Why not something a bit more interesting? Answers to this are numerous. A
  useful object of meditation should be one that promotes mindfulness. It should be
  portable, easily available and cheap. It should also be something that will not embroil
  us in those states of mind from which we are trying to free ourselves, such as greed,
  anger and delusion. Breathing satisfies all these criteria and more. Breathing is
  something common to every human being. We all carry it with us wherever we go. It is
  always there, constantly available, never ceasing from birth till death, and it costs
  nothing.
  
  Breathing is a non-conceptual process, a thing that can be experienced directly without
  a need for thought. Furthermore, it is a very living process, an aspect of life that is
  in constant change. The breath moves in cycles - inhalation, exhalation, breathing in
  and breathing out. Thus it is a miniature model of life itself.
  
  The sensation of breath is subtle, yet it is quite distinct when you learn to tune into
  it. It takes a bit of an effort to find it. Yet anybody can do it. You've got to work at
  it, but not too hard. For all these reasons, breathing makes an ideal object of
  meditation. Breathing is normally an involuntary process, proceeding at its own pace
  without a conscious will. Yet a single act of will can slow it down or speed it up. Make
  it long and smooth or short and choppy. The balance between involuntary breathing and
  forced manipulation of breath is quite delicate. And there are lessons to be learned
  here on the nature of will and desire. Then, too, that point at the tip of the nostril
  can be viewed as a sort of a window between the inner and outer worlds. IT is a nexus
  point and energy-transfer spot where stuff from the outside world moves in and becomes a
  part of what we call 'me', and where a part of me flows forth to merge with the outside
  world. There are lessons to be learned here about self-concept and how we form it.
  
  Breath is a phenomenon common to all living things. A true experiential understanding of
  the process moves you closer to other living beings. It shows you your inherent
  connectedness with all of life. Finally, breathing is a present-time process. By that we
  mean it is always occurring in the here-and-now. We don't normally live in the present,
  of course. We spend most of our time caught up in memories of the past or leaping ahead
  to the future, full of worries and plans. The breath has none of that
  'other-timeness'. When we truly observe the breath, we are automatically placed in the
  present. We are pulled out of the morass of mental images and into a bare experience of
  the here- and-now. In this sense, breath is a living slice of reality. A mindful
  observation of such a miniature model of life itself leads to insight that are broadly
  applicable to the rest of our experience.
  
  The first step in using the breath as an object of meditation is to find it. What you
  are looking for is the physical, tactile sensation of the air that passes in and out of
  the nostrils. This is usually just inside the tip of the nose. But the exact spot varies
  from one person to another, depending on the shape of the nose. To find your won point,
  take a quick deep breath and notice the point just inside the nose or on the upper lip
  where you have the most distinct sensation of passing air. Now exhale and notice the
  sensation at the same point. IT is from this point that you will follow the whole
  passage of breath. Once you have located your own breath point with clarity, don't
  deviate from that spot. Use this single point in order to keep your attention
  fixed. Without having selected such a point, you will find yourself moving in and out of
  the nose, going up and down the windpipe, eternally chasing after the breath which you
  can never catch because it keeps changing, moving and flowing.
  
  If you ever sawed wood you already know the trick. As a carpenter, you don't stand there
  watching the saw blade going up and down. You will get dizzy. You fix your attention on
  the spot where the teeth of the blade dig into the wood. It is the only way you can saw
  a straight line. As a meditator, you focus your attention on that single spot of
  sensation inside the nose. From this vantage point, you watch the entire movement of
  breath with clear and collected attention. Make no attempt to control the breath. This
  is not a breathing exercise of the sort done in Yoga. Focus on the natural and
  spontaneous movement of the breath. Don't try to regulate it or emphasize it in any
  way. Most beginners have some trouble in this area. In order to help themselves focus on
  the sensation, they unconsciously accentuate their breathing. The results is a forced
  and unnatural effort that actually inhibits concentration rather than helping it. Don't
  increase the depth of your breath or its sound. This latter point is especially
  important in group meditation. Loud breathing can be a real annoyance to those around
  you. Just let the breath move naturally, as if you were asleep. Let go and allow the
  process to go along at its own rhythm.
  
  This sounds easy, but it is trickier than you think. Do not be discouraged if you find
  your own will getting in the way. Just use that as an opportunity to observe the nature
  of conscious intention. Watch the delicate interrelation between the breath, the impulse
  to control the breath and the impulse to cease controlling the breath. You may find it
  frustrating for a while, but it is highly profitable as a learning experience, and it is
  a passing phase. Eventually, the breathing process will move along under its own
  steam. And you will feel no impulse to manipulate it. At this point you will have
  learned a major lesson about your own compulsive need to control the universe.
  
  Breathing, which seems so mundane and uninteresting at first glance, is actually an
  enormously complex and fascinating procedure. It is full of delicate variations, if you
  look. There is inhalation and exhalation, long breath and short breath, deep breath,
  shallow breath, smooth breath and ragged breath. These categories combine with one
  another in subtle and intricate ways. Observe the breath closely. Really study it. You
  find enormous variations and constant cycle of repeated patterns. It is like a
  symphony. Don't observe just the bare outline of the breath. There is more to see here
  than just an in-breath and an out-breath. Every breath has a beginning middle and
  end. Every inhalation goes through a process of birth, growth and death and every
  exhalation does the same. The depth and speed of your breathing changes according to
  your emotional state, the thought that flows through your mind and the sounds you
  hear. Study these phenomena. You will find them fascinating.
  
  This does not mean, however, that you should be sitting there having little
  conversations with yourself inside your head: "There is a short ragged breath and there
  is a deep long one. I wonder what's next?" No, that is not Vipassana. That is
  thinking. You will find this sort of thing happening, especially in the beginning. This
  too is a passing phase. Simply note the phenomenon and return your attention toward the
  observation of the sensation of breath. Mental distractions will happen again. But
  return your attention to your breath again, and again, and again, and again, for as long
  as it takes until it does not happen anymore.
  
  When you first begin this procedure, expect to face some difficulties. Your mind will
  wander off constantly, darting around like a drunken bumblebee and zooming off on wild
  tangents. Try not to worry. The monkey-minded phenomenon is well known. It is something
  that every advanced meditator has had to deal with. They have pushed through it one way
  or another, and so can you. When it happens, just not the fact that you have been
  thinking, day-dreaming, worrying, or whatever. Gently, but firmly, without getting upset
  or judging yourself for straying, simply return to the simple physical sensation of the
  breath. Then do it again the next time, and again, and again, and again.
  
  Somewhere in this process, you will come face-to-face with the sudden and shocking
  realization that you are completely crazy. Your mind is a shrieking, gibbering madhouse
  on wheels barreling pell-mell down the hill, utterly out of control and hopeless. No
  problem. You are not crazier than you were yesterday. It has always been this way, and
  you just never noticed. You are also no crazier than everybody else around you. The only
  real difference is that you have confronted the situation; they have not. So they still
  feel relatively comfortable. That does not mean that they are better off. Ignorance may
  be bliss, but it does not lead to liberation. So don't let this realization unsettle
  you. It is a milestone actually, a sign of real progress. The very fact that you have
  looked at the problem straight in the eye means that you are on your way up and out of
  it.
  
  In the wordless observation of the breath, there are two states to be avoided: thinking
  and sinking. The thinking mind manifests most clearly as the monkey-mind phenomenon we
  have just been discussing. The sinking mind is almost the reverse. As a general term,
  sinking mind denotes any dimming of awareness. At its best, it is sort of a mental
  vacuum in which there is no thought, no observation of the breath, no awareness of
  anything. It is a gap, a formless mental gray area rather like a dreamless
  sleep. Sinking mind is a void. Avoid it.
  
  Vipassana meditation is an active function. Concentration is a strong, energetic
  attention to one single item. Awareness is a bright clean alertness. Samadhi and Sati -
  these are the two faculties we wish to cultivate. And sinking mind contains neither. At
  its worst, it will put you to sleep. Even at its best it will simply waste your
  time. When you find you have fallen into a state of sinking mind, just note the fact and
  return your attention to the sensation of breathing. Observe the tactile sensation of
  the in-breath. Feel the touch sensation of the out-breath. Breathe in, breathe out and
  watch what happens. When you have been doing that for some time - perhaps weeks or
  months - you will begin to sense the touch as a physical object. Simply continue the
  process - breathe in and breathe out. Watch what happens. As your concentration deepens
  you will have less and less trouble with monkey-mind. Your breathing will slow down and
  you will track it more and more clearly, with fewer and fewer interruptions. You begin
  to experience a state of great calm in which you enjoy complete freedom from those
  things we call psychic irritants. No greed, lust, envy, jealousy or hatred. Agitation
  goes away. Fear flees. These are beautiful, clear, blissful states of mind. They are
  temporary, and they will end when meditation ends. Yet even these brief experiences will
  change your life. This is not liberation, but these are stepping stones on the path that
  leads in that direction. Do not, however, expect instant bliss. Even these stepping
  stones take time and effort and patience.
  
  The meditation experience is not a competition. There is a definite goal. But there is
  no timetable. What you are doing is digging your way deeper and deeper through the
  layers of illusion toward realization of the supreme truth of existence. The process
  itself is fascinating and fulfilling. It can be enjoyed for its own sake. There is no
  need to rush.
  
  At the end of a well-done meditation session you will feel a delightful freshness of
  mind. It is peaceful, buoyant, and joyous energy which you can then apply to the
  problems of daily living. This in itself is reward enough. The purpose of meditation is
  not to deal with problems, however, and problem- solving ability is a fringe benefit and
  should be regarded as such. If you place too much emphasis on the problem-solving
  aspect, you will find your attention turning to those problems during the session
  sidetracking concentration. Don't think about your problems during your practice. Push
  them aside very gently.
  
  Take a break from all that worrying and planning. Let your meditation be a complete
  vacation. Trust yourself, trust your own ability to deal with these issues later, using
  the energy and freshness of mind that you built up during your meditation. Trust
  yourself this way and it will actually occur.
  
  Don't set goals for yourself that are too high to reach. Be gentle with yourself. You
  are trying to follow your own breathing continuously and without a break. That sounds
  easy enough, so you will have a tendency at the outset to push yourself to be scrupulous
  and exacting.
  
  This is unrealistic. Take time in small units instead. At the beginning of an
  inhalation, make the resolve to follow the breath just for the period of that one
  inhalation. Even this is not so easy, but at least it can be done. Then, at the start of
  the exhalation, resolve to follow the breath just for that one exhalation, all the way
  through. You will still fail repeatedly, but keep at it.
  
  Every time you stumble, start over. Take it one breath at a time. This is the level of
  the game where you can actually win. Stick at it--fresh resolve with every breath cycle,
  tiny units of time. Observe each breath with care and precision, taking it one split
  second on top of another, with fresh resolve piled one on top of the other. In this way,
  continuous and unbroken awareness will eventually result.
  
  Mindfulness of breathing is a present-time awareness. When you are doing it properly,
  you are aware only of what is occurring in the present. You don't look back and you
  don't look forward. You forget about the last breath, and you don't anticipate the next
  one. When the inhalation is just beginning, you don't look ahead to the end of that
  inhalation. You don't skip forward to the exhalation which is to follow. You stay right
  there with what is actually taking place. The inhalation is beginning, and that's what
  you pay attention to; that and nothing else.
  
  This meditation is a process of retraining the mind. The state you are aiming for is one
  in which you are totally aware of everything that is happening in your own perceptual
  universe, exactly the way it happens, exactly when it is happening; total, unbroken
  awareness in the present time. This is an incredibly high goal, and not to be reached
  all at once. It takes practice, so we start small. We start by becoming totally aware of
  one small unit of time, just one single inhalation. And, when you succeed, you are on
  your way to a whole new experience of life.
  
* Chapter 8 - Structuring Your Meditation
  Everything up to this point has been theory. Now let's dive into the actual
  practice. Just how do we go about this thing called meditation.
  
  First of all, you need to establish a formal practice schedule, a specific period when
  you will do Vipassana meditation and nothing else. When you were a baby, you did not
  know how to walk. Somebody went to a lot of trouble to teach you that skill. They
  dragged you by the arms. They gave you lots of encouragement. Made you put one foot in
  front of the other until you could do it by yourself. Those periods of instruction
  constituted a formal practice in the art of walking.
  
  In meditation, we follow the same basic procedure. We set aside a certain time,
  specifically devoted to developing this mental skill called mindfulness. We devote these
  times exclusively to that activity, and we structure our environment so there will be a
  minimum of distraction. This is not the easiest skill in the world to learn. We have
  spent our entire life developing mental habits that are really quite contrary to the
  ideal of uninterrupted mindfulness. Extricating ourselves from those habits requires a
  bit of strategy. As we said earlier, our minds are like cups of muddy water. The object
  of meditation is to clarify this sludge so that we can see what is going on in
  there. The best way to do that is just let it sit. Give it enough time and it will
  settle down. You wind up with clear water. In meditation, we set aside a specific time
  for this clarifying process. When viewed from the outside, it looks utterly useless. We
  sit there apparently as productive as a stone gargoyle. Inside, however, quite a bit is
  happening. The mental soup settles down, and we are left with a clarity of mind that
  prepares us to cope with the upcoming events of our lives.
  
  That does not mean that we have to do anything to force this settling. It is a natural
  process that happens by itself. The very act of sitting still being mindful causes this
  settling. In fact, any effort on our part to force this settling is
  counterproductive. That is repression, and it does not work. Try to force things out of
  the mind and you merely add energy to them. You may succeed temporarily, but in the long
  run you will only have made them stronger. They will hide in the unconscious until you
  are not watching, then they will leap out and leave you helpless to fight them off.
  
  The best way to clarify the mental fluid is to just let it settle all by itself. Don't
  add any energy to the situation. Just mindfully watch the mud swirl, without any
  involvement in the process. Then, when it settles at last, it will stay settled. We
  exert energy in meditation, but not force. Our only effort is gentle, patient
  mindfulness. The meditation period is like a cross-section of your whole day. Everything
  that happens to you is stored away in the mind in some form, mental or emotional. During
  normal activity, you get so caught up in the press of events that the basic issues with
  which you are dealing are seldom thoroughly handled. They become buried in the
  unconscious, where they seethe and foam and fester. Then you wonder where all that
  tension came from. All of this material comes forth in one form or another during your
  meditation. You get a chance to look at it, see it for what it is, and let it go. We set
  up a formal meditation period in order to create a conducive environment for this
  release. We re-establish our mindfulness at regular intervals. We withdraw from those
  events which constantly stimulate the mind. We back out of all the activity that prods
  the emotions. We go off to a quiet place and we sit still, and it all comes bubbling
  out. Then it goes away. The net effect is like recharging a battery. Meditation
  recharges your mindfulness.
  
**  Where To Sit
  
    Find yourself a quiet place, a secluded place, a place where you will be alone. It
    doesn't have to be some ideal spot in the middle of a forest. That's nearly impossible
    for most of us, but it should be a place where you feel comfortable, and where you
    won't be disturbed. It should also be a place where you won't feel on display. You
    want all of your attention free for meditation, not wasted on worries about how you
    look to others. Try to pick a spot that is as quiet as possible. It doesn't have to be
    a soundproof room, but there are certain noises that are highly distracting, and they
    should be avoided. Music and talking are about the worst. The mind tends to be sucked
    in by these sounds in an uncontrollable manner, and there goes your concentration.
  
    There are certain traditional aids that you can employ to set the proper mood. A
    darkened room with a candle is nice. Incense is nice. A little bell to start and end
    your sessions is nice. These are paraphernalia, though. They provide encouragement to
    some people, but they are by no means essential to the practice. You will probably
    find it helpful to sit in the same place each time. A special spot reserved for
    meditation and nothing else is an aid for most people. You soon come to associate that
    spot with the tranquility of deep concentration, and that association helps you to
    reach deep states more quickly. The main thing is to sit in a place that you feel is
    conducive to your own practice. That requires a bit of experimentation. Try several
    spots until you find one where you feel comfortable. You only need to find a place
    where you don't feel self-conscious, and where you can meditate without undue
    distraction.
  
    Many people find it helpful and supportive to sit with a group of other
    meditators. The discipline of regular practice is essential, and most people find it
    easier to sit regularly if they are bolstered by a commitment to a group sitting
    schedule. You've given your word, and you know you are expected. Thus the 'I'm too
    busy' syndrome is cleverly skirted. You may be able to locate a group of practicing
    meditators in your area. It doesn't matter if they practice a different form of
    meditation, so long as it's one of the silent forms. On the other hand, you also
    should try to be self-sufficient in your practice. Don't rely on the presence of a
    group as your sole motivation to sit. Properly done, sitting is a pleasure. Use the
    group as an aid, not as a crutch.
  
**  When To Sit
    
    The most important rule here is this: When it comes to sitting, the description of
    Buddhism as the Middle Way applies. Don't overdo it. Don't underdo it. This doesn't
    mean you just sit whenever the whim strikes you. It means you set up a practice
    schedule and keep to it with a gentle, patient tenacity. Setting up a schedule acts as
    an encouragement. If, however, you find that your schedule has ceased to be an
    encouragement and becomes a burden, then something is wrong. Meditation is not a duty,
    nor an obligation.
    
    Meditation is psychological activity. You will be dealing with the raw stuff of
    feelings and emotions. Consequently, it is an activity which is very sensitive to the
    attitude with which you approach each session. What you expect is what you are most
    likely to get. Your practice will therefore go best when you are looking forward to
    sitting. If you sit down expecting grinding drudgery, that is probably what will
    occur. So set up a daily pattern that you can live with. Make it reasonable. Make it
    fit with the rest of your life. And if it starts to feel like you're on an uphill
    treadmill toward liberation, then change something.
    
    First thing in the morning is a great time to meditate. Your mind is fresh then,
    before you've gotten yourself buried in responsibilities. Morning meditation is a fine
    way to start the day. It tunes you up and gets you ready to deal with things
    efficiently. You cruise through the rest of the day just a bit more lightly. Be sure
    you are thoroughly awake, though. You won't make much progress if you are sitting
    there nodding off, so get enough sleep. Wash your face, or shower before you
    begin. You may want to do a bit of exercise beforehand to get the circulation
    flowing. Do whatever you need to do in order to wake up fully, then sit down to
    meditate. Do not, however, let yourself get hung up in the day's activities. It's just
    too easy to forget to sit. Make meditation the first major thing you do in the
    morning.
    
    The evening is another good time for practice. Your mind is full of all the mental
    rubbish that you have accumulated during the day, and it is great to get rid of the
    burden before you sleep. Your meditation will cleanse and rejuvenate your mind. Re-
    establish your mindfulness and your sleep will be real sleep. When you first start
    meditation, once a day is enough. If you feel like meditating more, that's fine, but
    don't overdo it. There's a burn-out phenomenon we often see in new meditators. They
    dive right into the practice fifteen hours a day for a couple of weeks, and then the
    real world catches up with them. They decide that this meditation business just takes
    too much time. Too many sacrifices are required. They haven't got time for all of
    this. Don't fall into that trap. Don't burn yourself out the first week. Make haste
    slowly. Make your effort consistent and steady. Give yourself time to incorporate the
    meditation practice into your life, and let your practice grow gradually and gently.
    
    As your interest in meditation grows, you'll find yourself making more room in your
    schedule for practice. It's a spontaneous phenomenon, and it happens pretty much by
    itself--no force necessary.
    
    Seasoned meditators manage three or four hours of practice a day. They live ordinary
    lives in the day-to-day world, and they still squeeze it all in. And they enjoy it. It
    comes naturally.
    
**  How Long To Sit
    
    A similar rule applies here: Sit as long as you can, but don't overdo. Most beginners
    start with twenty or thirty minutes. Initially, it's difficult to sit longer than that
    with profit. The posture is unfamiliar to Westerners, and it takes a bit of time for
    the body to adjust. The mental skills are equally unfamiliar, and that adjustment
    takes time, too.
    
    As you grow accustomed to procedure, you can extend your meditation little by
    little. We recommend that after a year or so of steady practice you should be sitting
    comfortably for an hour at a time.
    
    Here is an important point, though: Vipassana meditation is not a form of
    asceticism. Self-mortification is not the goal. We are trying to cultivate
    mindfulness, not pain. Some pain is inevitable, especially in the legs. We will
    thoroughly cover pain, and how to handle it, in Chapter 10. There are special
    techniques and attitudes which you will learn for dealing with discomfort. The point
    to be made here is this: This is not a grim endurance contest. You don't need to prove
    anything to anybody. So don't force yourself to sit with excruciating pain just to be
    able to say that you sat for an hour. That is a useless exercise in ego. And don't
    overdo it in the beginning. Know your limitations, and don't condemn yourself for not
    being able to sit forever, like a rock.
    
    As meditation becomes more and more a part of your life, you can extend your sessions
    beyond an hour. As a general rule, just determine what is a comfortable length of time
    for you at this point in your life. Then sit five minutes longer than that. There is
    no hard and fast rule about length of time for sitting. Even if you have established a
    firm minimum, there may be days when it is physically impossible for you to sit that
    long. That doesn't mean that you should just cancel the whole idea for that day. It's
    crucial to sit regularly. Even ten minutes of meditation can be very
    beneficial. Incidentally, you decide on the length of your session before you
    meditate. Don't do it while you are meditating. It's too easy to give in to
    restlessness that way, and restlessness is one of the main items that we want to learn
    to mindfully observe. So choose a realistic length of time, and then stick to it.
    
    You can use a watch to time your sessions, but don't peek at it every two minutes to
    see how you are doing. Your concentration will be completely lost, and agitation will
    set in. You'll find your self hoping to get up before the session is over. That's not
    meditation - that's clock watching. Don't look at the clock until you think the whole
    meditation period has passed. Actually, you don't need to consult the clock at all, at
    least not every time you meditate. In general, you should be sitting for as long as
    you want to sit. There is no magic length of time. It is best, though, to set yourself
    a minimum length of time. If you haven't predetermined a minimum, you'll find yourself
    prone to short sessions. You'll bolt every time something unpleasant comes up or
    whenever you feel restless. That's not good. These experiences are some of the most
    profitable a meditator can face, but only if you sit through them. You've got to learn
    to observe them calmly and clearly. Look at them mindfully. When you've done that
    enough times, they lose their hold on you. You see them for what they are: just
    impulses, arising and passing away, just part of the passing show. Your life smoothes
    out beautifully as a consequence.
    
    'Discipline' is a difficult word for most of us. It conjures up images of somebody
    standing over you with a stick, telling you that you're wrong. But self-discipline is
    different. It's the skill of seeing through the hollow shouting of your own impulses
    and piercing their secret. They have no power over you. It's all a show, a
    deception. Your urges scream and bluster at you; they cajole; they coax; they
    threaten; but they really carry no stick at all. You give in out of habit. You give in
    because you never really bother to look beyond the threat. It is all empty back
    there. There is only one way to learn this lesson, though. The words on this page
    won't do it. But look within and watch the stuff coming up--restlessness, anxiety,
    impatience, pain-- just watch it come up and don't get involved. Much to your
    surprise, it will simply go away. It rises, it passes away. As simple as that. There
    is another word for 'self-discipline'. It is 'Patience'.
* Chapter 9 - Set Up Exercises
  In Theravada Buddhist countries, it is traditional to begin each meditation session with
  the recitation of a certain set of formulas. An American audience is likely to take one
  glance at these invocations and to dismiss them as harmless rituals and nothing
  more. The so-called rituals, however, have been devised and refined by a set of
  pragmatic and dedicated men and women, and they have a thoroughly practical
  purpose. They are therefore worthy of deeper inspection.
  
  The Buddha was considered contrary in his own day. He was born into an intensely
  over-ritualized society, and his ideas appeared thoroughly iconoclastic to the
  established hierarchy of his own era. On numerous occasions, he disavowed the use of
  rituals for their own sake, and he was quite adamant about it. This does not mean that
  ritual has no use. It means that ritual by itself, performed strictly for it's own sake,
  will not get you out of the trap. If you believe that mere recitation of words will save
  you, then you only increase your own dependence on words and concepts. This moves you
  away from the wordless perception of reality rather than toward it. Therefore, the
  formulae which follow must be practiced with a clear understanding of what they are and
  why they work. They are not magical incantations. They are psychological cleansing
  devices which require active mental participation in order to be effective. Mumbled
  words without intention are useless. Vipassana meditation is a delicate psychological
  activity, and the mental set of the practitioner is crucial to its success. The
  technique works best in an atmosphere of calm, benevolent confidence. And these
  recitations have been designed to foster those attitudes. Correctly used, they can act
  as a helpful tool on the path to liberation.
  
** The Threefold Guidance
   
   Meditation is a tough job. It is an inherently solitary activity. One person battles
   against enormously powerful forces, part of the very structure of the mind doing the
   meditating. When you really get into it, you will eventually find yourself confronted
   with a shocking realization. One day you will look inside and realize the full enormity
   of what you are actually up against. What you are struggling to pierce looks like a
   solid wall so tightly knit that not a single ray of light shines through. You find
   yourself sitting there, staring at this edifice and you say to yourself, "That? I am
   supposed to get past that? But it's impossible! That is all there is. That is the whole
   world. That is what everything means, and that is what I use to define myself and to
   understand everything around me, and if I take that away the whole world will fall
   apart and I will die. I cannot get through that. I just can't."
   
   It is a very scary feeling, a very lonely feeling. You feel like, "Here I am, all
   alone, trying to punch away something so huge it is beyond conception." To counteract
   this feeling, it is useful to know that you are not alone. Others have passed this way
   before. They have confronted that same barrier, and they have pushed their way through
   to the light. They have laid out the rules by which the job can be done, and they have
   banded together into a brotherhood for mutual encouragement and support. The Buddha
   found his way through this very same wall, and after him came many others. He left
   clear instructions in the form of the Dhamma to guide us along the same path. And he
   founded the Sangha, the brotherhood of monks to preserve that path and to keep each
   other on it. You are not alone, and the situation is not hopeless.
   
   Meditation takes energy. You need courage to confront some pretty difficult mental
   phenomena and the determination to sit through various unpleasant mental
   states. Laziness just will not serve. In order to pump up your energy for the job,
   repeat the following statements to yourself. Feel the intention you put into them. Mean
   what you say.
   
   "I am about to tread the very path that has been walked by the Buddha and by his great
   and holy disciples. An indolent person cannot follow that path. May my energy
   prevail. May I succeed."
   
** Universal Loving-Kindness
   
   Vipassana meditation is an exercise in mindfulness, egoless awareness. It is a
   procedure in which the ego will be eradicated by the penetrating gaze of
   mindfulness. The practitioner begins this process with the ego in full command of mind
   and body. Then, as mindfulness watches the ego function, it penetrates to the roots of
   the mechanics of ego and extinguishes ego piece by piece. There is a full blown
   Catch-22 in all this, however. Mindfulness is egoless awareness. If we start with ego
   in full control, how do we put enough mindfulness there at the beginning to get the job
   started? There is always some mindfulness present in any moment. The real problem is to
   gather enough of it to be effective. To do this we can use a clever tactic. We can
   weaken those aspects of ego which do the most harm, so that mindfulness will have less
   resistance to overcome.
   
   Greed and hatred are the prime manifestations of the ego process. To the extent that
   grasping and rejecting are present in the mind, mindfulness will have a very rough
   time. The results of this are easy to see. If you sit down to meditate while you are in
   the grip of some strong obsessive attachment, you will find that you will get
   nowhere. If you are all hung up in your latest scheme to make more money, you probably
   will spend most of your meditation period doing nothing but thinking about it. If you
   are in a black fury over some recent insult, that will occupy your mind just as
   fully. There is only so much time in one day, and your meditation minutes are
   precious. It is best not to waste them. The Theravada tradition has developed a useful
   tool which will allow you to remove these barriers from your mind at least temporarily,
   so that you can get on with the job of removing their roots permanently.
   
   You can use one idea to cancel another. You can balance a negative emotion by
   instilling a positive one. Giving is the opposite of greed. Benevolence is the opposite
   of hatred. Understand clearly now: This is not an attempt to liberate yourself by
   autohypnosis. You cannot condition Enlightenment. Nibbana is an unconditioned state. A
   liberated person will indeed be generous and benevolent, but not because he has been
   conditioned to be so. He will be so purely as a manifestation of his own basic nature,
   which is no longer inhibited by ego. So this is not conditioning. This is rather
   psychological medicine. If you take this medicine according to directions, it will
   bring temporary relief from the symptoms of the malady from which you are currently
   suffering. Then you can get to work in earnest on the illness itself.
   
   You start out by banishing thoughts of self-hatred and self- condemnation. You allow
   good feelings and good wishes first to flow to yourself, which is relatively easy. Then
   you do the same for those people closest to you. Gradually, you work outward from your
   own circle of intimates until you can direct a flow of those same emotions to your
   enemies and to all living beings everywhere. Correctly done, this can be a powerful and
   transformative exercise in itself.
   
   At the beginning of each meditation session, say the following sentences to
   yourself. Really feel the intention:
   
   
    1. May I be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to me. May no difficulties come
       to me. May no problems come to me. May I always meet with success.

       May I also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and
       overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.

    2. May my parents be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to them. May no
       difficulties come to them. May no problems come to them. May they always meet with
       success.

       May they also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and
       overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.

    3. May my teachers be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to them. May no
       difficulties come to them. May no problems come to them. May they always meet with
       success.

       May they also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and
       overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.

    4. May my relatives be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to them. May no
       difficulties come to them. May no problems come to them. May they always meet with
       success.

       May they also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and
       overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.

    5. May my friends be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to them. May no
       difficulties come to them. May no problems come to them. May they always meet with
       success.

       May they also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and
       overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.

    6. May all indifferent persons be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to
       them. May no difficulties come to them. May no problems come to them. May they
       always meet with success.

       May they also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and
       overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.

    7. May my enemies be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to them. May no
       difficulties come to them. May no problems come to them. May they always meet with
       success.

       May they also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and
       overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.

    8. May all living beings be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to them. May no
       difficulties come to them. May no problems come to them. May they always meet with
       success.

       May they also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and
       overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life.

       
    Once you have completed these recitations, lay aside all your troubles and conflicts
    for the period of practice. Just drop the whole bundle. If they come back into your
    meditation later, just treat them as what they are, distractions.
    
    The practice of Universal Loving-Kindness is also recommended for bedtime and just
    after arising. It is said to help you sleep well and to prevent nightmares. It also
    makes it easier to get up in the morning. And it makes you more friendly and open
    toward everybody, friend or foe, human or otherwise.
    
    The most damaging psychic irritant arising in the mind particularly at the time when
    the mind is quiet, is resentment. You may experience indignation remembering some
    incident that caused you psychological and physical pain. This experience can cause
    you uneasiness, tension, agitation and worry. You might not be able to go on sitting
    and experiencing this state of mind. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you should
    start your meditation with generating Universal Loving-Kindness.
    
    You sometimes may wonder how can we wish: "May my enemies be well, happy and
    peaceful. May no harm come to them; may no difficulty come to them; may no problem
    come to them; may they always meet with success. May they also have patience, courage,
    understanding and determination to meet and overcome inevitable difficulties, problems
    and failures in life"?
    
    You must remember that you practice loving-kindness for the purification of your own
    mind, just as you practice meditation for your own attainment of peace and liberation
    from pain and suffering. As you practice loving-kindness within yourself, you can
    behave in a most friendly manner without biases, prejudices, discrimination or
    hate. Your noble behavior helps you to help others in a most practical manner to
    reduce their pain and suffering. It is compassionate people who can help
    others. Compassion as a manifestation of loving-kindness in action, for one who does
    not have loving-kindness cannot help others. Noble behavior means behaving in a most
    friendly and most cordial manner. Behavior includes your thought speech and action. If
    this triple mode of expression of your behavior is contradictory behavior cannot be
    noble behavior. On the other hand, pragmatically speaking, it is much better to
    cultivate the noble thought, "May all beings be happy minded" than the thought, "I
    hate him". Our noble thought will one day express itself in noble behavior and our
    spiteful thought in evil behavior.
    
    Remember that your thoughts are transformed into speech and action in order to bring
    the expected result. Thought translated into action is capable of producing tangible
    result. You should always speak and do things with mindfulness of
    loving-kindness. While speaking of loving-kindness, if you act or speak in a
    diametrically opposite way you will be reproached by the wise. As mindfulness of
    loving-kindness develops, your thoughts, words and deeds should be gentle, pleasant,
    meaningful, truthful and beneficial to you as well as to others. If your thoughts,
    words or deeds cause harm to you, to others or to both, then you must ask yourself
    whether you are really mindful of loving-kindness.
    
    For all practical purposes, if all of your enemies are well, happy and peaceful, they
    would not be your enemies. If they are free from problems, pain, suffering,
    affliction, neurosis, psychosis, paranoia, fear, tension, anxiety, etc., they would
    not be your enemies. Your practical solution to your enemies is to help them to
    overcome their problems, so you can live in peace and happiness. In fact, if you can,
    you should fill the minds of all your enemies with loving-kindness and make all of
    them realize the true meaning of peace, so you can live in peace and happiness. The
    more they are in neurosis, psychosis, fear, tension, anxiety, etc., the more trouble,
    pain and suffering they can bring to the world. If you could convert a vicious and
    wicked person into a holy and saintly individual, you would perform a miracle. Let us
    cultivate adequate wisdom and loving- kindness within ourselves to convert evil minds
    to saintly minds.
    
    When you hate somebody you think, "Let him be ugly. Let him lie in pain. Let him have
    no prosperity. Let him not be right. Let him not be famous. Let him have no friends
    Let him, after death, reappear in an unhappy state of depravation in a bad destination
    in perdition." However, what actually happens is that your own body generates such
    harmful chemistry that you experience pain, increased heart beat, tension, change of
    facial expression, loss of appetite for food, deprivation of sleep and appear very
    unpleasant to others. You go through the same things you wish for your enemy. Also you
    cannot see the truth as it is. Your mind is like boiling water. Or you are like a
    patient suffering from jaundice to whom any delicious food tastes bland. Similarly,
    you cannot appreciate somebody's appearance, achievement, success, etc. As long as
    this condition exists, you cannot meditate well.
    
    Therefore we recommend very strongly that you practice loving- kindness before you
    start your serious practice of meditation. Repeat the proceeding passages very
    mindfully and meaningfully. As you recite these passages, feel true loving-kindness
    within yourself first and then share it with others, for you cannot share with others
    what you do not have within yourself.
    
    Remember, though, these are not magic formulas. They don't work by themselves. If you
    use them as such, you will simply waste time and energy. But if you truly participate
    in these statements and invest them with your own energy, they will serve you
    will. Give them a try. See for yourself.
* Chapter 10 - Dealing With Problems
  You are going to run into problems in your meditation. Everybody does. Problems come in
  all shapes and sizes, and the only thing you can be absolutely certain about is that you
  will have some. The main trick in dealing with obstacles is to adopt the right
  attitude. Difficulties are an integral part of your practice. They aren't something to
  be avoided. They are something to be used. They provide invaluable opportunities for
  learning.
  
  The reason we are all stuck in life's mud is that we ceaselessly run from our problems
  and after our desires. Meditation provides us with a laboratory situation in which we
  can examine this syndrome and devise strategies for dealing with it. The various snags
  and hassles that arise during meditation are grist for the mill. They are the material
  on which we work. There is no pleasure without some degree of pain. There is no pain
  without some amount of pleasure. Life is composed of joys and miseries. They go
  hand-in-hand. Meditation is no exception. You will experience good times and bad times,
  ecstasies and frightening times.
  
  So don't be surprised when you hit some experience that feels like a brick wall. Don't
  think you are special. Every seasoned meditator has had his own brick walls. They come
  up again and again. Just expect them and be ready to cope. Your ability to cope with
  trouble depends upon your attitude. If you can learn to regard these hassles as
  opportunities, as chances to develop in your practice, you'll make progress. Your
  ability to deal with some issue that arises in meditation will carry over into the rest
  of your life and allow you to smooth out the big issues that really bother you. If you
  try to avoid each piece of nastiness that arises in meditation, you are simply
  reinforcing the habit that has already made life seem so unbearable at times.
  
  It is essential to learn to confront the less pleasant aspects of existence. Our job as
  meditators is to learn to be patient with ourselves, to see ourselves in an unbiased
  way, complete with all our sorrows and inadequacies. We have to learn to be kind to
  ourselves. In the long run, avoiding unpleasantness is a very unkind thing to do to
  yourself. Paradoxically, kindness entails confronting unpleasantness when it arises. One
  popular human strategy for dealing with difficulty is autosuggestion: when something
  nasty pops up, you convince yourself it is pleasant rather than unpleasant. The Buddha's
  tactic is quite the reverse. Rather than hide it or disguise it, the Buddha's teaching
  urges you to examine it to death. Buddhism advises you not to implant feelings that you
  don't really have or avoid feelings that you do have. If you are miserable you are
  miserable; this is the reality, that is what is happening, so confront that. Look it
  square in the eye without flinching. When you are having a bad time, examine the
  badness, observe it mindfully, study the phenomenon and learn its mechanics. The way out
  of a trap is to study the trap itself, learn how it is built. You do this by taking the
  thing apart piece by piece. The trap can't trap you if it has been taken to pieces. The
  result is freedom.
  
  This point is essential, but it is one of the least understood aspects of Buddhist
  philosophy. Those who have studied Buddhism superficially are quick to conclude that it
  is a pessimistic set of teachings, always harping on unpleasant things like suffering,
  always urging us to confront the uncomfortable realities of pain, death and
  illness. Buddhist thinkers do not regard themselves as pessimists - quite the opposite,
  actually. Pain exists in the universe; some measure of it is unavoidable. Learning to
  deal with it is not pessimism, but a very pragmatic form of optimism. How would you deal
  with the death of your spouse? How would you feel if you lost your mother tomorrow? Or
  your sister or your closest friend? Suppose you lost your job, your savings, and the use
  of your hands, on the same day; could you face the prospect of spending the rest of your
  life in a wheelchair? How are you going to cope with the pain of terminal cancer if you
  contract it, and how will you deal with your own death, when that approaches? You may
  escape most of these misfortunes, but you won't escape all of them. Most of us lose
  friends and relatives at some time during our lives; all of us get sick now and then; at
  the very least you are going to die someday. You can suffer through things like that or
  you can face them openly - the choice is yours.
  
  Pain is inevitable, suffering is not. Pain and suffering are two different animals. If
  any of these tragedies strike you in your present state of mind, you will suffer. The
  habit patterns that presently control your mind will lock you into that suffering and
  there will be no escape. A bit of time spent in learning alternatives to those habit
  patterns is time well-invested. Most human beings spend all their energies devising ways
  to increase their pleasure and decrease their pain. Buddhism does not advise that you
  cease this activity altogether. Money and security are fine. Pain should be avoided
  where possible. Nobody is telling you to give away all your possessions or seek out
  needless pain, but Buddhism does advise you to invest some of your time and energy in
  learning to deal with unpleasantness, because some pain is unavoidable.
  
  When you see a truck bearing down on you, by all means jump out of the way. But spend
  some time in meditation, too. Learning to deal with discomfort is the only way you'll be
  ready to handle the truck you didn't see.
  
  Problems arise in your practice. Some of them will be physical, some will be emotional,
  and some will be attitudinal. All of them are confrontable and each has its own specific
  response. All of them are opportunities to free yourself.
  
** Problem 1 - Physical Pain
   
   Nobody likes pain, yet everybody has some sometime. It is one of life's most common
   experiences and is bound to arise in your meditation in one form or another. Handling
   pain is a two-stage process. First, get rid of the pain if possible or at least get rid
   of it as much as possible. Then, if some pain lingers, use it as an object of
   meditation.
   
   The first step is physical handling. Maybe the pain is an illness of one sort or
   another, a headache, fever, bruises or whatever. In this case, employ standard medical
   treatments before you sit down to meditate: take your medicine, apply your liniment, do
   whatever you ordinarily do. Then there are certain pains that are specific to the
   seated posture. If you never spend much time sitting cross-legged on the floor, there
   will be an adjustment period. Some discomfort is nearly inevitable. According to where
   the pain is, there are specific remedies. If the pain is in the leg or knees, check you
   pants. If they are tight or made of thick material, that could be the problem. Try to
   change it. Check your cushion, too. It should be about three inches in height when
   compressed. If the pain is around your waist, try loosening your belt. Loosen the
   waistband of your pants if that is necessary. If you experience pain in your lower
   back, your posture is probably at fault. Slouching will never be comfortable, so
   straighten up. Don't be tight or rigid, but do keep your spine erect. Pain in the neck
   or upper back has several sources. The first is improper hand position. Your hands
   should be resting comfortably in your lap. Don't pull them up to your waist. Relax your
   arms and your neck muscles. Don't let your head droop forward. Keep it up and aligned
   with the rest of the spine.
   
   After you have made all these various adjustments, you may find you still have some
   lingering pain. If that is the case, try step two. Make the pain your object of
   meditation. Don't jump up and down and get excited. Just observe the pain
   mindfully. When the pain becomes demanding, you will find it pulling your attention off
   the breath. Don't fight back. Just let your attention slide easily over onto the simple
   sensation. Go into the pain fully. Don't block the experience. Explore the feeling. Get
   beyond your avoiding reaction and go into the pure sensations that lie below that. You
   will discover that there are two things present. The first is the simple sensation -
   pain itself. Second is your resistance to that sensation. Resistance reaction is partly
   mental and partly physical. The physical part consists of tensing the muscles in and
   around the painful area. Relax those muscles. Take them one by one and relax each one
   very thoroughly. This step alone probably diminishes the pain significantly. Then go
   after the mental side of the resistance. Just as you are tensing physically, you are
   also tensing psychologically. You are clamping down mentally on the sensation of pain,
   trying to screen it off and reject it from consciousness. The rejection is a wordless,
   "I don't like this feeling" or "go away" attitude. It is very subtle. But it is there,
   and you can find it if you really look. Locate it and relax that, too.
   
   That last part is more subtle. There are really no human words to describe this action
   precisely. The best way to get a handle on it is by analogy. Examine what you did to
   those tight muscles and transfer that same action over to the mental sphere; relax the
   mind in the same way that you relax the body. Buddhism recognizes that the body and
   mind are tightly linked. This is so true that many people will not see this as a
   two-step procedure. For them to relax the body is to relax the mind and vice
   versa. These people will experience the entire relaxation, mental and physical, as a
   single process. In any case, just let go completely till you awareness slows down past
   that barrier which you yourself erected. It was a gap, a sense of distance between self
   and others. It was a borderline between 'me' and 'the pain'. Dissolve that barrier, and
   separation vanishes. You slow down into that sea of surging sensation and you merge
   with the pain. You become the pain. You watch its ebb and flow and something surprising
   happens. It no longer hurts. Suffering is gone. Only the pain remains, an experience,
   nothing more. The 'me' who was being hurt has gone. The result is freedom from pain.
   
   This is an incremental process. In the beginning, you can expect to succeed with small
   pains and be defeated by big ones. Like most of our skills, it grows with practice. The
   more you practice, the bigger the pain you can handle. Please understand fully. There
   is no masochism being advocated here. Self-mortification is not the point.
   
   This is an exercise in awareness, not in sadism. If the pain becomes excruciating, go
   ahead and move, but move slowly and mindfully. Observe your movements. See how it feels
   to move. Watch what it does to the pain. Watch the pain diminish. Try not to move too
   much though. The less you move, the easier it is to remain fully mindful. New
   meditators sometimes say they have trouble remaining mindful when pain is present. This
   difficulty stems from a misunderstanding. These students are conceiving mindfulness as
   something distinct from the experience of pain. It is not. Mindfulness never exists by
   itself. It always has some object and one object is as good as another. Pain is a
   mental state. You can be mindful of pain just as you are mindful of breathing.
   
   The rules we covered in Chapter 4 apply to pain just as they apply to any other mental
   state. You must be careful not to reach beyond the sensation and not to fall short of
   it. Don't add anything to it, and don't miss any part of it. Don't muddy the pure
   experience with concepts or pictures or discursive thinking. And keep your awareness
   right in the present time, right with the pain, so that you won't miss its beginning or
   its end. Pain not viewed in the clear light of mindfulness gives rise to emotional
   reactions like fear, anxiety, or anger. If it is properly viewed, we have no such
   reaction. IT will be just sensation, just simple energy. Once you have learned this
   technique with physical pain, you can then generalize it in the rest of your life. You
   can use it on any unpleasant sensation. What works on pain will work on anxiety or
   chronic depression. This technique is one of life's most useful and generalizable
   skills. It is patience.
   
** Problem 2 - Legs Going To Sleep
   
   It is very common for beginners to have their legs fall asleep or go numb during
   meditation. They are simply not accustomed to the cross-legged posture. Some people get
   very anxious about this. They feel they must get up and move around. A few are
   completely convinced that they will get gangrene from lack of circulation. Numbness in
   the leg is nothing to worry about. It is caused by nerve-pinch, not by lack of
   circulation. You can't damage the tissues of your legs by sitting. So relax. When your
   legs fall asleep in meditation, just mindfully observe the phenomenon. Examine what it
   feels like. It may be sort of uncomfortable, but it is not painful unless you tense
   up. Just stay calm and watch it. It does not matter if your legs go numb and stay that
   way for the whole period. After you have meditated for some time, that numbness
   gradually will disappear. Your body simply adjusts to daily practice. Then you can sit
   for very long sessions with no numbness whatever.
   
** Problem 3 - Odd Sensations
   
   People experience all manner of varied phenomena in meditation. Some people get
   itches. Others feel tingling, deep relaxation, a feeling of lightness or a floating
   sensation. You may feel yourself growing or shrinking or rising up in the
   air. Beginners often get quite excited over such sensations. As relaxation sets in, the
   nervous system simply begins to pass sensory signals more efficiently. Large amounts of
   previously blocked sensory data can pour through, giving rise to all manner of unique
   sensations. It does not signify anything in particular. It is just sensation. So simply
   employ the normal technique. Watch it come up and watch it pass away. Don't get
   involved.
   
** Problem 4 - Drowsiness
   
   It is quite common to experience drowsiness during meditation. You become very calm and
   relaxed. That is exactly what is supposed to happen. Unfortunately, we ordinarily
   experience this lovely state only when we are falling asleep, and we associate it with
   that process. So naturally, you begin to drift off. When you find this happening, apply
   your mindfulness to the state of drowsiness itself. Drowsiness has certain definite
   characteristics. It does certain things to your thought process. Find out what. It has
   certain body feelings associated with it. Locate those.
   
   This inquisitive awareness is the direct opposite of drowsiness, and will evaporate
   it. If it does not, then you should suspect a physical cause of your sleepiness. Search
   that out and handle it. If you have just eaten a large meal, that could be the
   cause. It is best to eat lightly before you meditate. Or wait an hour after a big
   meal. And don't overlook the obvious either. If you have been out loading bricks all
   day, you are naturally going to be tired. The same is true if you only got a few hours
   sleep the night before. Take care of your body's physical needs. Then meditate. Do not
   give in to sleepiness. Stay awake and mindful, for sleep and meditative concentration
   are two diametrically opposite experiences. You will not gain any new insight from
   sleep, but only from meditation. If you are very sleepy then take a deep breath and
   hold it as long as you can. Then breathe out slowly. Take another deep breath again,
   hold it as long as you can and breathe out slowly. Repeat this exercise until your body
   warms up and sleepiness fades away. Then return to your breath.
   
** Problem 5 - Inability To Concentrate
   
   An overactive, jumping attention is something that everybody experiences from time to
   time. It is generally handled by techniques presented in the chapter on
   distractions. You should also be informed, however, that there are certain external
   factors which contribute to this phenomenon. And these are best handled by simple
   adjustments in your schedule. Mental images are powerful entities. They can remain in
   the mind for long periods. All of the storytelling arts are direct manipulation of such
   material, and to the extent the writer has done his job well, the characters and images
   presented will have a powerful and lingering effect on the mind. If you have been to
   the best movie of the year, the meditation which follows is going to be full of those
   images. If you are halfway through the scariest horror novel you ever read, your
   meditation is going to be full of monsters. So switch the order of events. Do your
   meditation first. Then read or go to the movies.
   
   Another influential factor is your own emotional state. If there is some real conflict
   in your life, that agitation will carry over into meditation. Try to resolve your
   immediate daily conflicts before meditation when you can. Your life will run smoother,
   and you won't be pondering uselessly in your practice. But don't use this advice as a
   way to avoid meditation. Sometimes you can't resolve every issue before you sit. Just
   go ahead and sit anyway. Use your meditation to let go of all the egocentric attitudes
   that keep you trapped within your own limited viewpoint. Your problems will resolve
   much more easily thereafter. And then there are those days when it seems that the mind
   will never rest, but you can't locate any apparent cause. Remember the cyclic
   alternation we spoke of earlier. Meditation goes in cycles. You have good days and you
   have bad days.
   
   Vipassana meditation is primarily an exercise in awareness. Emptying the mind is not as
   important as being mindful of what the mind is doing. If you are frantic and you can't
   do a thing to stop it, just observe. It is all you. The result will be one more step
   forward in your journey of self-exploration. Above all, don't get frustrated over the
   nonstop chatter of your mind. That babble is just one more thing to be mindful of.
   
** Problem 6 - Boredom
   
   It is difficult to imagine anything more inherently boring than sitting still for an
   hour with nothing to do but feel the air going in and out of your nose. You are going
   to run into boredom repeatedly in your meditation. Everybody does. Boredom is a mental
   state and should be treated as such. A few simple strategies will help you to cope.
   
*** Tactic A: Re-establish true mindfulness
    
    If the breath seems an exceedingly dull thing to observe over and over, you may rest
    assured of one thing: You have ceased to observe the process with true
    mindfulness. Mindfulness is never boring. Look again. Don't assume that you know what
    breath is. Don't take it for granted that you have already seen everything there is to
    see. If you do, you are conceptualizing the process. You are not observing its living
    reality. When you are clearly mindful of breath or indeed anything else, it is never
    boring. Mindfulness looks at everything with the eyes of a child, with the sense of
    wonder. Mindfulness sees every second as if it were the first and the only second in
    the universe. So look again.
    
*** Tactic B: Observe your mental state
    
    Look at your state of boredom mindfully. What is boredom? Where is boredom? What does
    it feel like? What are its mental components? Does it have any physical feeling? What
    does it do to your thought process? Take a fresh look at boredom, as if you have never
    experienced that state before.
    
** Problem 7 - Fear
   
   States of fear sometimes arise during meditation for no discernible reason. It is a
   common phenomenon, and there can be a number of causes. You may be experiencing the
   effect of something repressed long ago. Remember, thoughts arise first in the
   unconscious. The emotional contents of a thought complex often leach through into your
   conscious awareness long before the thought itself surfaces. If you sit through the
   fear, the memory itself may bubble up where you can endure it. Or you may be dealing
   directly with that fear which we all fear: 'fear of the unknown'. At some point in your
   meditation career, you will be struck with the seriousness of what you are actually
   doing. You are tearing down the wall of illusion you have always used to explain life
   to yourself and to shield yourself from the intense flame of reality. You are about to
   meet ultimate truth face to face. That is scary. But it has to be dealt with
   eventually. Go ahead and dive right in.
   
   A third possibility: the fear that you are feeling may be self-generated. It may be
   arising out of unskillful concentration. You may have set an unconscious program to
   'examine what comes up.' Thus when a frightening fantasy arises, concentration locks
   onto it and the fantasy feeds on the energy of your attention and grows. The real
   problem here is that mindfulness is weak. If mindfulness was strongly developed, it
   would notice this switch of attention as soon as it occurred and handle the situation
   in the usual manner. Not matter what the source of your fear, mindfulness is the
   cure. Observe the emotional reactions that come along and know them for what they
   are. Stand aside from the process and don't get involved. Treat the whole dynamic as if
   you were an interested bystander. Most importantly, don't fight the situation. Don't
   try to repress the memories or the feelings or the fantasies. Just step out of the way
   and let the whole mess bubble up and flow past. It can't hurt you. It is just
   memory. It is only fantasy. It is nothing but fear. When you let it run its course in
   the arena of conscious attention, it won't sink back into the unconscious. It won't
   come back to haunt you later. It will be gone for good.
   
** Problem 8 - Agitation
   
   Restlessness is often a cover-up for some deeper experience taking place in the
   unconscious. We humans are great at repressing things. Rather than confronting some
   unpleasant thought we experience, we try to bury it. We won't have to deal with the
   issue. Unfortunately, we usually don't succeed, at least not fully. We hide the
   thought, but the mental energy we use to cover it up sits there and boils. The result
   is that sense of uneasiness which we call agitation or restlessness. There is nothing
   you can put your finger on. But you don't feel at ease. You can't relax. When this
   uncomfortable state arises in mediation, just observe it. Don't let it rule you. Don't
   jump up and run off. And don't struggle with it and try to make it go away. Just let it
   be there and watch it closely. Then the repressed material will eventually surface and
   you will find out what you have been worrying about.
   
   The unpleasant experience that you have been trying to avoid could be almost anything:
   Guilt, greed or problems. It could be a low-grade pain or subtle sickness or
   approaching illness. Whatever it is, let it arise and look at it mindfully. If you just
   sit still and observe your agitation, it will eventually pass. Sitting through
   restlessness is a little breakthrough in your meditation career. It will teach you
   much. You will find that agitation is actually a rather superficial mental state. It is
   inherently ephemeral. It comes and it goes. It has no real grip on you at all. Here
   again the rest of your life will profit.
   
** Problem 9 - Trying Too Hard
   
   Advanced meditators are generally found to be pretty jovial men and women. They possess
   that most valuable of all human treasures, a sense of humor. It is not the superficial
   witty repartee of the talk show host. It is a real sense of humor. They can laugh at
   their own human failures. They can chuckle at personal disasters. Beginners in
   meditation are often much too serious for their own good. So laugh a little. It is
   important to learn to loosen up in your session, to relax into your meditation. You
   need to learn to flow with whatever happens. You can't do that if you are tensed and
   striving, taking it all so very, very seriously. New meditators are often overly eager
   for results. They are full of enormous and inflated expectations. They jump right in
   and expect incredible results in no time flat. They push. They tense. They sweat and
   strain, and it is all so terribly, terribly grim and solemn. This state of tension is
   the direct antithesis of mindfulness. So naturally they achieve little. Then they
   decide that this meditation is not so exciting after all. It did not give them what
   they wanted. They chuck it aside. It should be pointed out that you learn about
   meditation only by meditating. You learn what meditation is all about and where it
   leads only through direct experience of the thing itself. Therefore the beginner does
   not know where he is headed because he has developed little sense of where his practice
   is leading.
   
   The novice's expectation is inherently unrealistic and uninformed. As a newcomer to
   meditation, he or she would expect all the wrong things, and those expectations do you
   no good at all. They get in the way. Trying too hard leads to rigidity and unhappiness,
   to guilt and self-condemnation. When you are trying too hard, your effort becomes
   mechanical and that defeats mindfulness before it even gets started. You are
   well-advised to drop all that. Drop your expectations and straining. Simply meditate
   with a steady and balanced effort. Enjoy your mediation and don't load yourself down
   with sweat and struggles. Just be mindful. The meditation itself will take care of the
   future.
   
** Problem 10 - Discouragement
   
   The direct upshot of pushing too hard is frustration. You are in a state of
   tension. You get nowhere. You realize you are not making the progress you expected, so
   you get discouraged. You feel like a failure. It is all a very natural cycle, but a
   totally avoidable one. The source is striving after unrealistic
   expectations. Nevertheless, it is a common enough syndrome and, in spite of all the
   best advice, you may find it happening to you. There is a solution. If you find
   yourself discouraged, just observe your state of mind clearly. Don't add anything to
   it. Just watch it. A sense of failure is only another ephemeral emotional reaction. If
   you get involved, it feeds on your energy and grows. If you simply stand aside and
   watch it, it passes away.
   
   If you are discouraged over your perceived failure in meditation, that is especially
   easy to deal with. You feel you have failed in your practice. You have failed to be
   mindful. Simply become mindful of that sense of failure. You have just re-established
   your mindfulness with that single step. The reason for your sense of failure is nothing
   but memory. There is no such thing as failure in meditation. There are setbacks and
   difficulties. But there is no failure unless you give up entirely. Even if you spend
   twenty solid years getting nowhere, you can be mindful at any second you choose to do
   so. It is your decision. Regretting is only one more way of being unmindful. The
   instant that you realize that you have been unmindful, that realization itself is an
   act of mindfulness. So continue the process. Don't get sidetracked in an emotional
   reaction.
   
** Problem 11 - Resistance To Meditation
   
   There are times when you don't feel like meditating. The very idea seems
   obnoxious. Missing a single practice session is scarcely important, but it very easily
   becomes a habit. It is wiser to push on through the resistance. Go sit anyway. Observe
   this feeling of aversion. In most cases it is a passing emotion, a flash in the pan
   that will evaporate right in front of your eyes. Five minutes after you sit down it is
   gone. In other cases it is due to some sour mood that day, and it lasts longer. Still,
   it does pass. And it is better to get rid of it in twenty or thirty minutes of
   meditation than to carry it around with you and let it ruin the rest of your
   day. Another time, resistance may be due to some difficulty you are having with the
   practice itself. You may or may not know what that difficulty is. If the problem is
   known, handle it by one of the techniques given in this book. Once the problem is gone,
   resistance will be gone. If the problem is unknown, then you are going to have to tough
   it out. Just sit through the resistance and observe that mindfully. When it has finally
   run its course, it will pass. Then the problem causing it will probably bubble up in
   its wake, and you can deal with that.
   
   If resistance to meditation is a common feature of your practice, then you should
   suspect some subtle error in your basic attitude. Meditation is not a ritual conducted
   in a particular posture. It is not a painful exercise, or period of enforced
   boredom. And it is not some grim, solemn, obligation. Meditation is mindfulness. It is
   a new way of seeing and it is a form of play. Meditation is your friend. Come to regard
   it as such and resistance will wash away like smoke on a summer breeze.
   
   If you try all these possibilities and the resistance remains, then there may be a
   problem. There can be certain metaphysical snags that a meditator runs into which go
   far beyond the scope of this book. It is not common for new meditators to hit these,
   but it can happen. Don't give up. Go get help. Seek out qualified teachers of the
   Vipassana style of meditation and ask them to help you resolve the situation. Such
   people exist for exactly that purpose.
   
** Problem 12 - Stupor Or Dullness
   
   We have already discussed the sinking mind phenomenon. But there is a special route to
   that state you should watch for. Mental dullness can result as an unwanted byproduct of
   deepening concentration. As your relaxation deepens, muscles loosen and nerve
   transmission changes. This produces a very calm and light feeling in the body. you feel
   very still and somewhat divorced from the body. This is a very pleasant state and at
   first your concentration is quite good, nicely centered on the breath. As it continues,
   however, the pleasant feelings intensify and they distract your attention from the
   breath. You start to really enjoy that state and your mindfulness goes way down. Your
   attention winds up scattered, drifting listlessly through vague clouds of bliss. The
   result is a very unmindful state, sort of an ecstatic stupor. The cure, of course, is
   mindfulness. Mindfully observe these phenomena and they will dissipate. When blissful
   feelings arise accept them. There is no need to avoid them. Don't get wrapped up in
   them. They are physical feelings, so treat them as such. Observe feelings as
   feelings. Observe dullness as dullness. Watch them rise and watch them pass. Don't get
   involved.
   
   You will have problems in meditation. Everybody does. You can treat them as terrible
   torments, or as challenges to be overcome. If you regard them as burdens, your
   suffering will only increase. If you regard them as opportunities to learn and to grow,
   your spiritual prospects are unlimited.
* Chapter 11 - Dealing with Distractions - I
  At some time, every meditator encounters distractions during practice, and methods are
  needed to deal with them. Some elegant stratagems have been devised to get you back on
  the track more quickly than trying to push your way through by sheer force of
  will. Concentration and mindfulness go hand-in-hand. Each one complements the other. If
  either one is weak, the other will eventually be affected. Bad days are usually
  characterized by poor concentration. Your mind just keeps floating around. You need some
  method of reestablishing your concentration, even in the face of mental
  adversity. Luckily, you have it. In fact you can take your choice from a traditional
  array of practical maneuvers.
  
** Maneuver 1 - Time Gauging
   
   This first technique has been covered in an earlier chapter. A distraction has pulled
   you away from the breath, and you suddenly realize that you've been day-dreaming. The
   trick is to pull all the way out of whatever has captured you, to break its hold on you
   completely so you can go back to the breath with full attention. You do this by gauging
   the length of time that you were distracted. This is not a precise calculation. you
   don't need a precise figure, just a rough estimate. You can figure it in minutes, or by
   idea significance. Just say to yourself, "Okay, I have been distracted for about two
   minutes" or "Since the dog started barking" or "Since I started thinking about money."
   When you first start practicing this technique, you will do it by talking to yourself
   inside your head. Once the habit is well established, you can drop that, and the action
   becomes wordless and very quick. The whole idea, remember, is to pull out of the
   distraction and get back to the breath. You pull out of the thought by making it the
   object of inspection just long enough to glean from it a rough approximation of its
   duration. The interval itself is not important. Once you are free of the distraction,
   drop the whole thing and go back to the breath. Do not get hung up in the estimate.
   
** Maneuver 2 - Deep Breaths
   
   When your mind is wild and agitated, you can often re-establish mindfulness with a few
   quick deep breaths. Pull the air in strongly and let it out the same way. This
   increases the sensation inside the nostrils and makes it easier to focus. Make a strong
   act of will and apply some force to your attention. Concentration can be forced into
   growth, remember, so you will probably find your full attention settling nicely back on
   the breath.
   
** Maneuver 3 - Counting
   
   Counting the breaths as they pass is a highly traditional procedure. Some schools of
   practice teach this activity as their primary tactic. Vipassana uses it as an auxiliary
   technique for re-establishing mindfulness and for strengthening concentration. As we
   discussed in Chapter 5, you can count breaths in a number of different ways. Remember
   to keep your attention on the breath. You will probably notice a change after you have
   done your counting. The breath slows down, or it becomes very light and refined. This
   is a physiological signal that concentration has become well-established. At this
   point, the breath is usually so light or so fast and gently that you can't clearly
   distinguish the inhalation from the exhalation. They seem to blend into each other. You
   can then count both of them as a single cycle. Continue your counting process, but only
   up to a count of five, covering the same five-breath sequence, then start over. When
   counting becomes a bother, go on to the next step. Drop the numbers and forget about
   the concepts of inhalation and exhalation. Just dive right in to the pure sensation of
   breathing. Inhalation blends into exhalation. One breath blends into the next in a
   never ending cycle of pure, smooth flow.
   
** Maneuver 4 - The In-Out Method
   
   This is an alternative to counting, and it functions in much the manner. Just direct
   your attention to the breath and mentally tag each cycle with the words
   "Inhalation...exhalation" or 'In...out". Continue the process until you no longer need
   these concepts, and then throw them away.
   
** Maneuver 5 - Canceling One Thought With Another
   
   Some thoughts just won't go away. We humans are obsessional beings. It's one of our
   biggest problems. We tend to lock onto things like sexual fantasies and worries and
   ambitions. We feed those though complexes over the years of time and give them plenty
   of exercise by playing with them in every spare moment. Then when we sit down to
   meditate, we order them to go away and leave us alone. It is scarcely surprising that
   they don't obey. Persistent thoughts like these require a direct approach, a full-scale
   frontal attack.
   
   Buddhist psychology has developed a distinct system of classification. Rather than
   dividing thoughts into classes like 'good' or 'bad', Buddhist thinkers prefer to regard
   them as 'skillful' versus 'unskillful'. An unskillful thought is one connected with
   greed, hatred, or delusion. These are the thoughts that the mind most easily builds
   into obsessions. They are unskillful in the sense that they lead you away from the goal
   of Liberation. Skillful thoughts, on the other hand, are those connected with
   generosity, compassion, and wisdom. They are skillful in the sense that they may be
   used as specific remedies for unskillful thoughts, and thus can assist you toward
   Liberation.
   
   You cannot condition Liberation. It is not a state built out of thoughts. Nor can you
   condition the personal qualities which Liberation produces. Thoughts of benevolence can
   produce a semblance of benevolence, but it's not the real item. It will break down
   under pressure. Thoughts of compassion produce only superficial compassion. Therefore,
   these skillful thoughts will not, in themselves, free you from the trap. They are
   skillful only if applied as antidotes to the poison of unskillful thoughts. Thoughts of
   generosity can temporarily cancel greed. They kick it under the rug long enough for
   mindfulness to do its work unhindered. Then, when mindfulness has penetrated to the
   roots of the ego process, greed evaporates and true generosity arises.
   
   This principle can be used on a day to day basis in your own meditation. If a
   particular sort of obsession is troubling you, you can cancel it out by generating its
   opposite. Here is an example: If you absolutely hate Charlie, and his scowling face
   keeps popping into your mind, try directing a stream of love and friendliness toward
   Charlie. You probably will get rid of the immediate mental image. Then you can get on
   with the job of meditation.
   
   Sometimes this tactic alone doesn't work. The obsession is simply too strong. In this
   case you've got to weaken its hold on you somewhat before you can successfully balance
   it out. Here is where guilt, one of man's most misbegotten emotions, finally becomes of
   some use. Take a good strong look at the emotional response you are trying to get rid
   of. Actually ponder it. See how it makes you feel. Look at what it is doing to your
   life, your happiness, your health, and your relationships. Try to see how it makes you
   appear to others. Look at the way it is hindering your progress toward Liberation. The
   Pali scriptures urge you to do this very thoroughly indeed. They advise you to work up
   the same sense of disgust and humiliation that you would feel if you were forced to
   walk around with the carcass of a dead and decaying animal tied around your neck. Real
   loathing is what you are after. This step may end the problem all by itself. If it
   doesn't, then balance out the lingering remainder of the obsession by once again
   generating its opposite emotion.
   
   Thoughts of greed cover everything connected with desire, from outright avarice for
   material gain, all the way down to a subtle need to be respected as a moral
   person. Thoughts of hatred run the gamut from petty peevishness to murderous
   rage. Delusion covers everything from daydreaming through actual
   hallucinations. Generosity cancels greed. Benevolence and compassion cancel hatred. You
   can find a specific antidote for any troubling thought if you just think about it a
   while.
   
** Maneuver 6 - Recalling Your Purpose
   
   There are times when things pop into your mind, apparently at random. Words, phrases,
   or whole sentences jump up out of the unconscious for no discernible reason. Objects
   appear. Pictures flash on and off. This is an unsettling experience. Your mind feels
   like a flag flapping in a stiff wind. It washes back and forth like waves in the
   ocean. At times like this it is often enough just to remember why you are there. You
   can say to yourself, "I'm not sitting here just to waste my time with these
   thoughts. I'm here to focus my mind on the breath, which is universal and common to all
   living beings". Sometimes your mind will settle down, even before you complete this
   recitation. Other times you may have to repeat it several times before you refocus on
   the breath.
   
   These techniques can be used singly, or in combinations. Properly employed, they
   constitute quite an effective arsenal for your battle against the monkey mind.
* Chapter 12 - Dealing With Distractions - II
  So there you are meditating beautifully. Your body is totally immobile, and your mind is
  totally still. You just glide right along following the flow of the breath, in, out, in,
  out...calm, serene and concentrated. Everything is perfect. And then, all of a sudden,
  something totally different pops into your mind: "I sure wish I had an ice cream cone."
  That's a distraction, obviously. That's not what you are supposed to be doing. You
  notice that, and you drag yourself back to the breath, back to the smooth flow, in, out,
  in...and then: "Did I ever pay that gas bill?" Another distraction. You notice that one,
  and you haul yourself back to the breath. In, out, in, out, in..."That new science
  fiction movie is out. Maybe I can go see it Tuesday night. No, not Tuesday, got too much
  to do on Wednesday. Thursday's better..." Another distraction. You pull yourself out of
  that one and back you go to the breath, except that you never quite get there because
  before you do that little voice in your head goes, "My back is killing me." And on and
  on it goes, distraction after distraction, seemingly without end.
  
  What a bother. But this is what it is all about. These distractions are actually the
  whole point. The key is to learn to deal with these things. Learning to notice them
  without being trapped in them. That's what we are here for. The mental wandering is
  unpleasant, to be sure. But it is the normal mode of operation of your mind. Don't think
  of it as the enemy. It is just the simple reality. And if you want to change something,
  the first thing you have to do is see it the way it is.
  
  When you first sit down to concentrate on the breath, you will be struck by how
  incredibly busy the mind actually is. It jumps and jibbers. It veers and bucks. It
  chases itself around in constant circles. It chatters. It thinks. It fantasizes and
  daydreams. Don't be upset about that. it's natural. When your mind wanders from the
  subject of meditation, just observe the distraction mindfully.
  
  When we speak of a distraction in Insight Meditation, we are speaking of any
  preoccupation that pulls the attention off the breath. This brings up a new, major rule
  for your meditation: When any mental state arises strongly enough to distract you from
  the object of meditation, switch your attention to the distraction briefly. Make the
  distraction a temporary object of meditation. Please note the word temporary. It's quite
  important. We are not advising that you switch horses in midstream. We do not expect you
  to adopt a whole new object of meditation every three seconds. The breath will always
  remain your primary focus. You switch your attention to the distraction only long enough
  to notice certain specific things about it. What is it? How strong is it? and, how long
  does it last? As soon as you have wordlessly answered these questions, you are through
  with your examination of that distraction, and you return your attention to the
  breath. Here again, please note the operant term, wordlessly. These questions are not an
  invitation to more mental chatter. That would be moving you in the wrong direction,
  toward more thinking. We want you to move away from thinking, back to a direct, wordless
  and nonconceptual experience of the breath. These questions are designed to free you
  from the distraction and give you insight into its nature, not to get you more
  thoroughly stuck in it. They will tune you in to what is distracting you and help you
  get rid of it - all in one step.
  
  Here is the problem: When a distraction, or any mental state, arises in the mind, it
  blossoms forth first in the unconscious. Only a moment later does it rise to the
  conscious mind. That split-second difference is quite important, because it is time
  enough for grasping to occur. Grasping occurs almost instantaneously, and it takes place
  first in the unconscious. Thus, by the time the grasping rises to the level of conscious
  recognition, we have already begun to lock on to it. It is quite natural for us to
  simply continue that process, getting more and more tightly stuck in the distraction as
  we continue to view it. We are, by this time, quite definitely thinking the thought,
  rather than just viewing it with bare attention. The whole sequence takes place in a
  flash. This presents us with a problem. By the time we become consciously aware of a
  distraction we are already, in a sense, stuck in it. Our three questions are a clever
  remedy for this particular malady. In order to answer these questions, we must ascertain
  the quality of the distraction. To do that, we must divorce ourselves from it, take a
  mental step back from it, disengage from it, and view it objectively. We must stop
  thinking the thought or feeling the feeling in order to view it as an object of
  inspection. This very process is an exercise in mindfulness, uninvolved, detached
  awareness. The hold of the distraction is thus broken, and mindfulness is back in
  control. At this point, mindfulness makes a smooth transition back to its primary focus
  and we return to the breath.
  
  When you first begin to practice this technique, you will probably have to do it with
  words. You will ask your questions in words, and get answers in words. It won't be long,
  however, before you can dispense with the formality of words altogether. Once the mental
  habits are in place, you simply note the distraction, note the qualities of the
  distraction, and return to the breath. It's a totally nonconceptual process, and it's
  very quick. The distraction itself can be anything: a sound, a sensation, an emotion, a
  fantasy, anything at all. Whatever it is, don't try to repress it. Don't try to force it
  out of your mind. There's no need for that. Just observe it mindfully with bare
  attention. Examine the distraction wordlessly and it will pass away by itself. You will
  find your attention drifting effortlessly back to the breath. And do not condemn
  yourself for having being distracted. Distractions are natural. They come and they go.
  
  Despite this piece of sage counsel, you're going to find yourself condemning
  anyway. That's natural too. Just observe the process of condemnation as another
  distraction, and then return to the breath.
  
  Watch the sequence of events: Breathing. Breathing. Distracting thought
  arises. Frustration arising over the distracting thought. You condemn yourself for being
  distracted. You notice the self condemnation. You return to the
  breathing. Breathing. Breathing. It's really a very natural, smooth-flowing cycle, if
  you do it correctly. The trick, of course, is patience. If you can learn to observe
  these distractions without getting involved, it's all very easy. You just glide through
  the distractions and your attention returns to the breath quite easily. Of course, the
  very same distraction may pop up a moment later. If it does, just observe that
  mindfully. If you are dealing with an old, established thought pattern, this can go on
  happening for quite a while, sometimes years. Don't get upset. This too is natural. Just
  observe the distraction and return to the breath. Don't fight with these distracting
  thoughts. Don't strain or struggle. It's a waste. Every bit of energy that you apply to
  that resistance goes into the thought complex and makes it all the stronger. So don't
  try to force such thoughts out of your mind. It's a battle you can never win. Just
  observe the distraction mindfully and, it will eventually go away. It's very strange,
  but the more bare attention you pay to such disturbances, the weaker they get. Observe
  them long enough, and often enough, with bare attention, and they fade away
  forever. Fight with them and they gain in strength. Watch them with detachment and they
  wither.
  
  Mindfulness is a function that disarms distractions, in the same way that a munitions
  expert might defuse a bomb. Weak distractions are disarmed by a single glance. Shine the
  light of awareness on them and they evaporate instantly, never to return. Deep-seated,
  habitual thought patterns require constant mindfulness repeatedly applied over whatever
  time period it takes to break their hold. Distractions are really paper tigers. They
  have no power of their own. They need to be fed constantly, or else they die. If you
  refuse to feed them by your own fear, anger, and greed, they fade.
  
  Mindfulness is the most important aspect of meditation. It is the primary thing that you
  are trying to cultivate. So there is really no need at all to struggle against
  distractions. The crucial thing is to be mindful of what is occurring, not to control
  what is occurring. Remember, concentration is a tool. It is secondary to bare
  attention. From the point of view of mindfulness, there is really no such thing as a
  distraction. Whatever arises in the mind is viewed as just one more opportunity to
  cultivate mindfulness. Breath, remember, is an arbitrary focus, and it is used as our
  primary object of attention. Distractions are used as secondary objects of
  attention. They are certainly as much a part of reality as breath. It actually makes
  rather little difference what the object of mindfulness is. You can be mindful of the
  breath, or you can be mindful of the distraction. You can be mindful of the fact that
  you mind is still, and your concentration is strong, or you can be mindful of the fact
  that your concentration is in ribbons and your mind is in an absolute shambles. It's all
  mindfulness. Just maintain that mindfulness and concentration eventually will follow.
  
  The purpose of meditation is not to concentrate on the breath, without interruption,
  forever. That by itself would be a useless goal. The purpose of meditation is not to
  achieve a perfectly still and serene mind. Although a lovely state, it doesn't lead to
  liberation by itself. The purpose of meditation is to achieve uninterrupted
  mindfulness. Mindfulness, and only mindfulness, produces Enlightenment.
  
  Distractions come in all sizes, shapes and flavors. Buddhist philosophy has organized
  them into categories. One of them is the category of hindrances. They are called
  hindrances because they block your development of both components of mediation,
  mindfulness and concentration. A bit of caution on this term: The word 'hindrances'
  carries a negative connotation, and indeed these are states of mind we want to
  eradicate. That does not mean, however, that they are to be repressed, avoided or
  condemned.
  
  Let's use greed as an example. We wish to avoid prolonging any state of greed that
  arises, because a continuation of that state leads to bondage and sorrow. That does not
  mean we try to toss the thought out of the mind when it appears. We simply refuse to
  encourage it to stay. We let it come, and we let it go. When greed is first observed
  with bare attention, no value judgements are made. We simply stand back and watch it
  arise. The whole dynamic of greed from start to finish is simply observed in this
  way. We don't help it, or hinder it, or interfere with it in the slightest. It stays as
  long as it stays. And we learn as much about it as we can while it is there. We watch
  what greed does. We watch how it troubles us, and how it burdens others. We notice how
  it keeps us perpetually unsatisfied, forever in a state of unfulfilled longing. From
  this first-hand experience, we ascertain at a gut level that greed is an unskillful way
  to run your life. There is nothing theoretical about this realization.
  
  All of the hindrances are dealt with in the same way, and we will look at them here one
  by one.
  
  * Desire: :: Let us suppose you have been distracted by some nice experience in
               meditation. It could be pleasant fantasy or a thought of pride. It might be
               a feeling of self-esteem. It might be a thought of love or even the
               physical sensation of bliss that comes with the meditation experience
               itself. Whatever it is, what follows is the state of desire -- desire to
               obtain whatever you have been thinking about or desire to prolong the
               experience you are having. No matter what its nature, you should handle
               desire in the following manner. Notice the thought or sensation as it
               arises. Notice the mental state of desire which accompanies it as a
               separate thing. Notice the exact extent or degree of that desire. Then
               notice how long it lasts and when it finally disappears. When you have done
               that, return your attention to breathing.
  
  * Aversion: :: Suppose that you have been distracted by some negative experience. It
                 could be something you fear or some nagging worry. It might be guilt or
                 depression or pain. Whatever the actual substance of the thought or
                 sensation, you find yourself rejecting or repressing -- trying to avoid
                 it, resist it or deny it. The handling here is essentially the
                 same. Watch the arising of the thought or sensation. Notice the state of
                 rejection that comes with it. Gauge the extent or degree of that
                 rejection. See how long it lasts and when it fades away. Then return your
                 attention to your breath.
  
  * Lethargy: :: Lethargy comes in various grades and intensities, ranging from slight
                 drowsiness to total torpor. We are talking about a mental state here, not
                 a physical one. Sleepiness or physical fatigue is something quite
                 different and, in the Buddhist system of classification, it would be
                 categorized as a physical feeling. Mental lethargy is closely related to
                 aversion in that it is one of the mind's clever little ways of avoiding
                 those issues it finds unpleasant. Lethargy is a sort of turn-off of the
                 mental apparatus, a dulling of sensory and cognitive acuity. It is an
                 enforced stupidity pretending to be sleep. This can be a tough one to
                 deal with, because its presence is directly contrary to the employment of
                 mindfulness. Lethargy is nearly the reverse of mindfulness. Nevertheless,
                 mindfulness is the cure for this hindrance, too, and the handling is the
                 same. Note the state of drowsiness when it arises, and note its extent or
                 degree. Note when it arises, how long it lasts, and when it passes
                 away. The only thing special here is the importance of catching the
                 phenomenon early. You have got to get it right at its conception and
                 apply liberal doses of pure awareness right away. If you let it get a
                 start, its growth probably will out pace your mindfulness power. When
                 lethargy wins, the result is the sinking mind and/or sleep.
  
  * Agitation: :: States of restlessness and worry are expressions of mental
                  agitation. Your mind keeps darting around, refusing to settle on any one
                  thing. You may keep running over and over the same issues. But even here
                  an unsettled feeling is the predominant component. The mind refuses to
                  settle anywhere. It jumps around constantly. The cure for this condition
                  is the same basic sequence. Restlessness imparts a certain feeling to
                  consciousness. You might call it a flavor or texture. Whatever you call
                  it, that unsettled feeling is there as a definable characteristic. Look
                  for it. Once you have spotted it, note how much of it is present. Note
                  when it arises. Watch how long it lasts, and see when it fades
                  away. Then return your attention to the breath.
  
  * Doubt: :: Doubt has its own distinct feeling in consciousness. The Pali texts describe
              it very nicely. It's the feeling of a man stumbling through a desert and
              arriving at an unmarked crossroad. Which road should he take? There is no
              way to tell. So he just stands there vacillating. One of the common forms
              this takes in meditation is an inner dialogue something like this: "What am
              I doing just sitting like this? Am I really getting anything out of this at
              all? Oh! Sure I am. This is good for me. The book said so. No, that is
              crazy. This is a waste of time. No, I won't give up. I said I was going to
              do this, and I am going to do it. Or am I being just stubborn? I don't
              know. I just don't know." Don't get stuck in this trap. It is just another
              hindrance. Another of the mind's little smoke screens to keep you from doing
              the most terrible thing in the world: actually becoming aware of what is
              happening. To handle doubt, simply become aware of this mental state of
              wavering as an object of inspection. Don't be trapped in it. Back out of it
              and look at it. See how strong it is. See when it comes and how long it
              lasts. Then watch it fade away, and go back to the breathing.
  
  This is the general pattern you will use on any distraction that arises. By distraction,
  remember we mean any mental state that arises to impede your meditation. Some of these
  are quite subtle. It is useful to list some of the possibilities. The negative states
  are pretty easy to spot: insecurity, fear, anger, depression, irritation and
  frustration.
  
  Craving and desire are a bit more difficult to spot because they can apply to things we
  normally regard as virtuous or noble. You can experience the desire to perfect
  yourself. You can feel craving for greater virtue. You can even develop an attachment to
  the bliss of the meditation experience itself. It is a bit hard to detach yourself from
  such altruistic feelings. In the end, though, it is just more greed. It is a desire for
  gratification and a clever way of ignoring the present-time reality.
  
  Trickiest of all, however, are those really positive mental states that come creeping
  into your meditation. Happiness, peace, inner contentment, sympathy and compassion for
  all beings everywhere. These mental states are so sweet and so benevolent that you can
  scarcely bear to pry yourself loose from them. It makes you feel like a traitor to
  mankind. There is no need to feel this way. We are not advising you to reject these
  states of mind or to become heartless robots. We merely want you to see them for what
  they are. They are mental states. They come and they go. They arise and they pass
  away. As you continue your meditation, these states will arise more often. The trick is
  not to become attached to them. Just see each one as it comes up. See what it is, how
  strong it is and how long it lasts. Then watch it drift away. It is all just more of the
  passing show of your own mental universe.
  
  Just as breathing comes in stages, so do the mental states. Every breath has a
  beginning, a middle and an end. Every mental state has a birth, a growth and a
  decay. You should strive to see these stages clearly. This is no easy thing to do,
  however. As we have already noted, every thought and sensation begins first in the
  unconscious region of the mind and only later rises to consciousness. We generally
  become aware of such things only after they have arisen in the conscious realm and
  stayed there for some time. Indeed we usually become aware of distractions only when
  they have released their hold on us and are already on their way out. it is at this
  point that we are struck with the sudden realization that we have been somewhere,
  day-dreaming, fantasizing, or whatever. Quite obviously this is far too late in the
  chain of events. We may call this phenomenon catching the lion by his tail, and it is an
  unskillful thing to do. Like confronting a dangerous beast, we must approach mental
  states head-on. Patiently, we will learn to recognize them as they arise from
  progressively deeper levels of our conscious mind.
  
  Since mental states arise first in the unconscious, to catch the arising of the mental
  state, you've got to extend your awareness down into this unconscious area. That is
  difficult, because you can't see what is going on down there, at least not in the same
  way you see a conscious thought. But you can learn to get a vague sense of movement and
  to operate by a sort of mental sense of touch. This comes with practice, and the ability
  is another of the effects of the deep calm of concentration. Concentration slows down
  the arising of these mental states and gives you time to feel each one arising out of
  the unconscious even before you see it in consciousness. Concentration helps you to
  extend your awareness down into that boiling darkness where thought and sensation begin.
  
  As your concentration deepens, you gain the ability to see thoughts and sensations
  arising slowly, like separate bubbles, each distinct and with spaces between them. They
  bubble up in slow motion out of the unconscious. They stay a while in the conscious mind
  and then they drift away.
  
  The application of awareness to mental states is a precision operation. This is
  particularly true of feelings or sensations. It is very easy to overreach the
  sensation. That is, to add something to it above and beyond what is really there. It is
  equally easy to fall short of sensation, to get part of it but not all. The ideal that
  you are striving for is to experience each mental state fully, exactly the way it is,
  adding nothing to it and not missing any part of it. Let us use pain in the leg as an
  example. What is actually there is a pure flowing sensation. It changes constantly,
  never the same from one moment to the next. It moves from one location to another, and
  its intensity surges up and down. Pain is not a thing. It is an event. There should be
  no concepts tacked on to it and none associated with it. A pure unobstructed awareness
  of this event will experience it simply as a flowing pattern of energy and nothing
  more. No thought and no rejection. Just energy.
  
  Early on in our practice of meditation, we need to rethink our underlying assumptions
  regarding conceptualization. For most of us, we have earned high marks in school and in
  life for our ability to manipulate mental phenomena - concepts - logically. Our careers,
  much of our success in everyday life, our happy relationships, we view as largely the
  result of our successful manipulation of concepts. In developing mindfulness, however,
  we temporarily suspend the conceptualization process and focus on the pure nature of
  mental phenomena. During meditation we are seeking to experience the mind at the
  pre-concept level.
  
  But the human mind conceptualizes such occurrences as pain. You find yourself thinking
  of it as 'the pain'. That is a concept. It is a label, something added to the sensation
  itself. You find yourself building a mental image, a picture of the pain, seeing it as a
  shape. You may see a diagram of the leg with the pain outlined in some lovely
  color. This is very creative and terribly entertaining, but not what we want. Those are
  concepts tacked on to the living reality. Most likely, you will probably find yourself
  thinking: "I have a pain in my leg." 'I' is a concept. It is something extra added to
  the pure experience.
  
  When you introduce 'I' into the process, you are building a conceptual gap between the
  reality and the awareness viewing that reality. Thoughts such as 'Me', 'My' or 'Mine'
  have no place in direct awareness. They are extraneous addenda, and insidious ones at
  that. When you bring 'me' into the picture, you are identifying with the pain. That
  simply adds emphasis to it. If you leave 'I' out of the operation, pain is not
  painful. It is just a pure surging energy flow. It can even be beautiful. If you find
  'I' insinuating itself in your experience of pain or indeed any other sensation, then
  just observe that mindfully. Pay bare attention to the phenomenon of personal
  identification with the pain.
  
  The general idea, however, is almost too simple. You want to really see each sensation,
  whether it is pain, bliss or boredom. You want to experience that thing fully in its
  natural and unadulterated form. There is only one way to do this. Your timing has to be
  precise. Your awareness of each sensation must coordinate exactly with the arising of
  that sensation. If you catch it just a bit too late, you miss the beginning. You won't
  get all of it. If you hang on to any sensation past the time when it has memory. The
  thing itself is gone, and by holding onto that memory, you miss the arising of the next
  sensation. It is a very delicate operation. You've got to cruise along right here in
  present time, picking things up and letting things drop with no delays whatsoever. It
  takes a very light touch. Your relation to sensation should never be one of past or
  future but always of the simple and immediate now.
  
  The human mind seeks to conceptualize phenomena, and it has developed a host of clever
  ways to do so. Every simple sensation will trigger a burst of conceptual thinking if you
  give the mind its way. Lets us take hearing, for example. You are sitting in meditation
  and somebody in the next room drops a dish. The sounds strike your ear. Instantly you
  see a picture of that other room. You probably see a person dropping a dish, too. If
  this a familiar environment, say your own home, you probably will have a 3-D technicolor
  mind movie of who did the dropping and which dish was dropped. This whole sequence
  presents itself to consciousness instantly. It just jumps out of the unconscious so
  bright and clear and compelling that it shoves everything else out of sight. What
  happens to the original sensation, the pure experience of hearing? It got lost in the
  shuffle, completely overwhelmed and forgotten. We miss reality. We enter a world of
  fantasy.
  
  Here is another example: You are sitting in meditation and a sound strikes your ear. it
  is just an indistinct noise, sort of a muffled crunch; it could be anything. What
  happens next will probably be something like this. "What was that? Who did that? Where
  did that come from? How far away was that? Is it dangerous?". And on and on you go,
  getting no answers but your fantasy projection. Conceptualization is an insidiously
  clever process It creeps into you experience, and it simply takes over. When you hear a
  sound in meditation, pay bare attention to the experience of hearing. That and that
  only. What is really happening is so utterly simple that we can and do miss it
  altogether. Sound waves are striking the ear in a certain unique pattern. Those waves
  are being translated into electrical impulses within the brain and those impulses
  present a sound pattern to consciousness. That is all. No pictures. No mind movies. No
  concepts. No interior dialogues about the question. Just noise. Reality is elegantly
  simple and unadorned. When you hear a sound, be mindful of the process of
  hearing. Everything else is just added chatter. Drop it. The same rule applies to every
  sensation, every emotion, every experience you may have. Look closely at your own
  experience. Dig down through the layers of mental bric-a-brac and see what is really
  there. You will be amazed how simple it is, and how beautiful.
  
  There are times when a number of sensations may arise at once. You might have a thought
  of fear, a squeezing in the stomach and an aching back and an itch on your left earlobe,
  all at the same time. Don't sit there in a quandary. Don't keep switching back and forth
  or wondering what to pick. One of them will be strongest. Just open yourself up and the
  most insistent of these phenomena will intrude itself and demand your attention. So give
  it some attention just long enough to see it fade away. Then return to your
  breathing. If another one intrudes itself, let it in. When it is done, return to the
  breathing.
  
  This process can be carried too far, however. Don't sit there looking for things to be
  mindful of. Keep your mindfulness on the breath until something else steps in and pulls
  your attention away. When you feel that happening, don't fight it. Let you attention
  flow naturally over to the distraction, and keep it there until the distraction
  evaporates. Then return to breathing. Don't seek out other physical or mental
  phenomena. Just return to breathing. Let them come to you. There will be times when you
  drift off, of course. Even after long practice you find yourself suddenly waking up,
  realizing you have been off the track for some while. Don't get discouraged. Realize
  that you have been off the track for such and such a length of time and go back to the
  breath. There is no need for any negative reaction at all. The very act of realizing
  that you have been off the track is an active awareness. it is an exercise of pure
  mindfulness all by itself.
  
  Mindfulness grows by the exercise of mindfulness. It is like exercising a muscle. Every
  time you work it, you pump it up just a little. You make it a little stronger. The very
  fact that you have felt that wake-up sensation means that you have just improved your
  mindfulness power. That means you win. Move back to the breathing without
  regret. However, the regret is a conditioned reflex and it may come along
  anyway--another mental habit. If you find yourself getting frustrated, feeling
  discouraged, or condemning yourself, just observe that with bare attention. It is just
  another distraction. Give it some attention and watch it fade away, and return to the
  breath. The rules we have just reviewed can and should be applied thoroughly to all of
  your mental states. You are going to find this an utterly ruthless injunction. It is the
  toughest job that you will ever undertake. You will find yourself relatively willing to
  apply this technique to certain parts of your experience, and you will find yourself
  totally unwilling to use it on the other parts.
  
  Meditation is a bit like mental acid. It eats away slowly at whatever you put it on. We
  humans are very odd beings. We like the taste of certain poisons and we stubbornly
  continue to eat them even while they are killing us. Thoughts to which we are attached
  are poison. You will find yourself quite eager to dig some thoughts out by the roots
  while you jealously guard and cherish certain others. That is the human condition.
  
  Vipassana meditation is not a game. Clear awareness is more than a pleasurable
  pastime. It is a road up and out of the quagmire in which we are all stuck, the swamp of
  our own desires and aversions. It is relatively easy to apply awareness to the nastier
  aspects of your existence. Once you have seen fear and depression evaporate in the hot,
  intense beacon of awareness, you want to repeat the process. Those are the unpleasant
  mental states. They hurt. You want to get rid of those things because they bother
  you. It is a good deal harder to apply that same process to mental states which you
  cherish, like patriotism, or parental protectiveness or true love. But it is just as
  necessary. Positive attachments hold you in the mud just as assuredly as negative
  attachments. You may rise above the mud far enough to breathe a bit more easily if you
  practice Vipassana meditation with diligence. Vipassana meditation is the road to
  Nibbana. And from the reports of those who have toiled their way to that lofty goal, it
  is well worth every effort involved.
* Chapter 13 - Mindfulness (Sati)
  Mindfulness is the English translation of the Pali word Sati. Sati is an activity. What
  exactly is that? There can be no precise answer, at least not in words. Words are
  devised by the symbolic levels of the mind and they describe those realities with which
  symbolic thinking deals. Mindfulness is pre-symbolic.
  
  It is not shackled to logic. Nevertheless, Mindfulness can be experienced - rather
  easily - and it can be described, as long as you keep in mind that the words are only
  fingers pointing at the moon. They are not the thing itself. The actual experience lies
  beyond the words and above the symbols. Mindfulness could be described in completely
  different terms than will be used here and each description could still be correct.
  
  Mindfulness is a subtle process that you are using at this very moment. The fact that
  this process lies above and beyond words does not make it unreal - quite the
  reverse. Mindfulness is the reality which gives rise to words - the words that follow
  are simply pale shadows of reality. So, it is important to understand that everything
  that follows here is analogy. It is not going to make perfect sense. It will always
  remain beyond verbal logic. But you can experience it. The meditation technique called
  Vipassana (insight) that was introduced by the Buddha about twenty-five centuries ago is
  a set of mental activities specifically aimed at experiencing a state of uninterrupted
  Mindfulness.
  
  When you first become aware of something, there is a fleeting instant of pure awareness
  just before you conceptualize the thing, before you identify it. That is a stage of
  Mindfulness. Ordinarily, this stage is very short. It is that flashing split second just
  as you focus your eyes on the thing, just as you focus your mind on the thing, just
  before you objectify it, clamp down on it mentally and segregate it from the rest of
  existence. It takes place just before you start thinking about it - before your mind
  says, "Oh, it's a dog." That flowing, soft-focused moment of pure awareness is
  Mindfulness. In that brief flashing mind-moment you experience a thing as an
  un-thing. You experience a softly flowing moment of pure experience that is interlocked
  with the rest of reality, not separate from it. Mindfulness is very much like what you
  see with your peripheral vision as opposed to the hard focus of normal or central
  vision. yet this moment of soft, unfocused, awareness contains a very deep sort of
  knowing that is lost as soon as you focus your mind and objectify the object into a
  thing. In the process of ordinary perception, the Mindfulness step is so fleeting as to
  be unobservable. We have developed the habit of squandering our attention on all the
  remaining steps, focusing on the perception, recognizing the perception, labeling it,
  and most of all, getting involved in a long string of symbolic thought about it. That
  original moment of Mindfulness is rapidly passed over. It is the purpose of the above
  mentioned Vipassana (or insight) meditation to train us to prolong that moment of
  awareness.
  
  When this Mindfulness is prolonged by using proper techniques, you find that this
  experience is profound and it changes your entire view of the universe. This state of
  perception has to be learned, however, and it takes regular practice. Once you learn the
  technique, you will find that Mindfulness has many interesting aspects.
  
  Mindfulness is mirror-thought. It reflects only what is presently happening and in
  exactly the way it is happening. There are no biases.
  
  Mindfulness is non-judgmental observation. It is that ability of the mind to observe
  without criticism. With this ability, one sees things without condemnation or
  judgment. One is surprised by nothing. One simply takes a balanced interest in things
  exactly as they are in their natural states. One does not decide and does not judge. One
  just observes.
  
  It is psychologically impossible for us to objectively observe what is going on within
  us if we do not at the same time accept the occurrence of our various states of
  mind. This is especially true with unpleasant states of mind. In order to observe our
  own fear, we must accept the fact that we are afraid. We can't examine our own
  depression without accepting it fully. The same is true for irritation and agitation,
  frustration and all those other uncomfortable emotional states. You can't examine
  something fully if you are busy reflecting its existence. Whatever experience we may be
  having, Mindfulness just accepts it. It is simply another of life's occurrences, just
  another thing to be aware of. No pride, no shame, nothing personal at stake - what is
  there, is there.
  
  Mindfulness is an impartial watchfulness. It does not take sides. It does not get hung
  up in what is perceived. It just perceives. Mindfulness does not get infatuated with the
  good mental states. It does not try to sidestep the bad mental states. There is no
  clinging to the pleasant, no fleeing from the unpleasant. Mindfulness sees all
  experiences as equal, all thoughts as equal, all feelings as equal. Nothing is
  suppressed. Nothing is repressed. Mindfulness does not play favorites.
  
  Mindfulness is nonconceptual awareness. Another English term for Sati is 'bare
  attention'. It is not thinking. It does not get involved with thought or concepts. It
  does not get hung up on ideas or opinions or memories. It just looks. Mindfulness
  registers experiences, but it does not compare them. It does not label them or
  categorize them. It just observes everything as if it was occurring for the first
  time. It is not analysis which is based on reflection and memory. It is, rather, the
  direct and immediate experiencing of whatever is happening, without the medium of
  thought. It comes before thought in the perceptual process.
  
  Mindfulness is present time awareness. It takes place in the here and now. It is the
  observance of what is happening right now, in the present moment. It stays forever in
  the present, surging perpetually on the crest of the ongoing wave of passing time. If
  you are remembering your second-grade teacher, that is memory. When you then become
  aware that you are remembering your second-grade teacher, that is mindfulness. If you
  then conceptualize the process and say to yourself, "Oh, I am remembering", that is
  thinking.
  
  Mindfulness is non-egoistic alertness. It takes place without reference to self. With
  Mindfulness one sees all phenomena without references to concepts like 'me', 'my' or
  'mine'. For example, suppose there is pain in your left leg. Ordinary consciousness
  would say, "I have a pain." Using Mindfulness, one would simply note the sensation as a
  sensation. One would not tack on that extra concept 'I'. Mindfulness stops one from
  adding anything to perception, or subtracting anything from it. One does not enhance
  anything. One does not emphasize anything. One just observes exactly what is there -
  without distortion.
  
  Mindfulness is goal-less awareness. In Mindfulness, one does not strain for results. One
  does not try to accomplish anything. When one is mindful, one experiences reality in the
  present moment in whatever form it takes. There is nothing to be achieved. There is only
  observation.
  
  Mindfulness is awareness of change. it is observing the passing flow of experience. It
  is watching things as they are changing. it is seeing the birth, growth, and maturity of
  all phenomena. It is watching phenomena decay and die. Mindfulness is watching things
  moment by moment, continuously. It is observing all phenomena - physical, mental or
  emotional - whatever is presently taking place in the mind. One just sits back and
  watches the show. Mindfulness is the observance of the basic nature of each passing
  phenomenon. It is watching the thing arising and passing away. It is seeing how that
  thing makes us feel and how we react to it. It is observing how it affects others. In
  Mindfulness, one is an unbiased observer whose sole job is to keep track of the
  constantly passing show of the universe within. Please note that last point. In
  Mindfulness, one watches the universe within. The meditator who is developing
  Mindfulness is not concerned with the external universe. It is there, but in meditation,
  one's field of study is one's own experience, one's thoughts, one's feelings, and one's
  perceptions. In meditation, one is one's own laboratory. The universe within has an
  enormous fund of information containing the reflection of the external world and much
  more. An examination of this material leads to total freedom.
  
  Mindfulness is participatory observation. The meditator is both participant and observer
  at one and the same time. If one watches one's emotions or physical sensations, one is
  feeling them at that very same moment. Mindfulness is not an intellectual awareness. It
  is just here. Mindfulness is objective, but it is not cold or unfeeling. It is the
  wakeful experience of life, an alert participation in the ongoing process of living.
  
  Mindfulness is an extremely difficult concept to define in words - not because it is
  complex, but because it is too simple and open. The same problem crops up in every area
  of human experience. The most basic concept is always the most difficult to pin
  down. Look at a dictionary and you will see a clear example. Long words generally have
  concise definitions, but for short basic words like 'the' and 'is', definitions can be a
  page long. And in physics, the most difficult functions to describe are the most basic -
  those that deal with the most fundamental realities of quantum mechanics. Mindfulness is
  a pre-symbolic function. You can play with word symbols all day long and you will never
  pin it down completely. We can never fully express what it is. However, we can say what
  it does.
  
** Three Fundamental Activities
   
   There are three fundamental activities of Mindfulness. We can use these activities as
   functional definitions of the term: (1) Mindfulness reminds us of what we are supposed
   to be doing; (2) it sees things as they really are; and (3) it sees the deep nature of
   all phenomena. Let's examine these definitions in greater detail.
   
   Mindfulness reminds you of what you are supposed to be doing. In meditation, you put
   your attention on one item. When your mind wanders from this focus, it is Mindfulness
   that reminds you that your mind is wandering and what you are supposed to be doing. It
   is Mindfulness that brings your mind back to the object of meditation. All of this
   occurs instantaneously and without internal dialogue. Mindfulness is not
   thinking. Repeated practice in meditation establishes this function as a mental habit
   which then carries over into the rest of your life. A serious meditator pays bare
   attention to occurrences all the time, day in, day out, whether formally sitting in
   meditation or not. This is a very lofty ideal towards which those who meditate may be
   working for a period of years or even decades. Our habit of getting stuck in thought is
   years old, and that habit will hang on in the most tenacious manner. The only way out
   is to be equally persistent in the cultivation of constant Mindfulness. When
   Mindfulness is present, you will notice when you become stuck in your thought
   patterns. It is that very noticing which allows you to back out of the thought process
   and free yourself from it. Mindfulness then returns your attention to its proper
   focus. If you are meditating at that moment, then your focus will be the formal object
   of meditation. If your are not in formal meditation, it will be just a pure application
   of bare attention itself, just a pure noticing of whatever comes up without getting
   involved - "Ah, this comes up...and now this, and now this... and now this".
   
   Mindfulness is at one and the same time both bare attention itself and the function of
   reminding us to pay bare attention if we have ceased to do so. Bare attention is
   noticing. It re-establishes itself simply by noticing that it has not been present. As
   soon as you are noticing that you have not been noticing, then by definition you are
   noticing and then you are back again to paying bare attention.
   
   Mindfulness creates its own distinct feeling in consciousness. It has a flavor - a
   light, clear, energetic flavor. Conscious thought is heavy by comparison, ponderous and
   picky. But here again, these are just words. Your own practice will show you the
   difference. Then you will probably come up with your own words and the words used here
   will become superfluous. Remember, practice is the thing.
   
   Mindfulness sees things as they really are. It adds nothing to perception and it
   subtracts nothing. it distorts nothing. It is bare attention and just looks at whatever
   comes up. Conscious thought pastes things over our experience, loads us down with
   concepts and ideas, immerses us in a churning vortex of plans and worries, fears and
   fantasies. When mindful, you don't play that game. You just notice exactly what arises
   in the mind, then you notice the next thing. "Ah, this...and this...and now this." It
   is really very simple.
   
   Mindfulness sees the true nature of all phenomena. Mindfulness and only Mindfulness can
   perceive the three prime characteristics that Buddhism teaches are the deepest truths
   of existence. In Pali these three are called Anicca (impermanence), Dukkha
   (unsatisfactoriness), and Anatta (selflessness - the absence of a permanent,
   unchanging, entity that we call Soul or Self). These truths are not present in Buddhist
   teaching as dogmas demanding blind faith. The Buddhists feel that these truths are
   universal and self-evident to anyone who cares to investigate in a proper
   way. Mindfulness is the method of investigation. Mindfulness alone has the power to
   reveal the deepest level of reality available to human observation. At this level of
   inspection, one sees the following: (a) all conditioned things are inherently
   transitory; (b) every worldly thing is, in the end, unsatisfying; and (c) there are
   really no entities that are unchanging or permanent, only processes.
   
   Mindfulness works like an electron microscope. That is, it operates on so fine a level
   that one can actually see directly those realities which are at best theoretical
   constructs to the conscious thought process. Mindfulness actually sees the impermanent
   character of every perception. It sees the transitory and passing nature of everything
   that is perceived. It also sees the inherently unsatisfactory nature of all conditioned
   things. It sees that there is no sense grabbing onto any of these passing shows. Peace
   and happiness cannot be found that way. And finally, Mindfulness sees the inherent
   selflessness of all phenomena. It sees the way that we have arbitrarily selected a
   certain bundle of perceptions, chopped them off from the rest of the surging flow of
   experience and then conceptualized them as separate, enduring, entities. Mindfulness
   actually sees these things. It does not think about them, it sees them directly.
   
   When it is fully developed, Mindfulness sees these three attributes of existence
   directly, instantaneously, and without the intervening medium of conscious thought. In
   fact, even the attributes which we just covered are inherently arbitrary. They don't
   really exist as separate items. They are purely the result of our struggle to take this
   fundamentally simple process called Mindfulness and express it in the cumbersome and
   inherently unsuitable thought symbols of the conscious level. Mindfulness is a process,
   but it does not take place in steps. It is a holistic process that occurs as a unit:
   you notice your own lack of Mindfulness; and that noticing itself is a result of
   Mindfulness; and Mindfulness is bare attention; and bare attention is noticing things
   exactly as they are without distortion; and the way they are is Anicca, Dukkha, and
   Anatta (impermanent, unsatisfactory, and self-less). It all takes place in the space of
   a few mind-moments. This does not mean, however, that you will instantly attain
   liberation (freedom from all human weaknesses) as a result of your first moment of
   Mindfulness. Learning to integrate this material into your conscious life is another
   whole process. And learning to prolong this state of Mindfulness is still another. They
   are joyous processes, however, and they are well worth the effort.
   
** Mindfulness (Sati) and Insight (Vipassana) Meditation
   
   Mindfulness is the center of Vipassana Meditation and the key to the whole process. it
   is both the goal of this meditation and the means to that end. You reach Mindfulness by
   being ever more mindful. One other Pali word that is translated into English as
   Mindfulness is Appamada, which means non-negligence or an absence of madness. One who
   attends constantly to what is really going on in one's mind achieves the state of
   ultimate sanity.
   
   The Pali term Sati also bears the connotation of remembering. It is not memory in the
   sense of ideas and pictures from the past, but rather clear, direct, wordless knowing
   of what is and what is not, of what is correct and what is incorrect, of what we are
   doing and how we should go about it. Mindfulness reminds the meditator to apply his
   attention to the proper object at the proper time and to exert precisely the amount of
   energy needed to do the job. When this energy is properly applied, the meditator stays
   constantly in a state of calm and alertness. As long as this condition is maintained,
   those mind-states called 'hindrances' or 'psychic irritants' cannot arise - there is no
   greed, no hatred, no lust or laziness. But we all are human and we do err. Most of us
   are very human and we err repeatedly. Despite honest effort, the meditator lets his
   Mindfulness slip now and then and he finds himself stuck in some regrettable, but
   normal, human failure. It is Mindfulness that notices that change. And it is
   Mindfulness that reminds him to apply the energy required to pull himself out. These
   slips happen over and over, but their frequency decreases with practice. Once
   Mindfulness has pushed these mental defilements aside, more wholesome states of mind
   can take their place. Hatred makes way for loving kindness, lust is replaced by
   detachment. It is Mindfulness which notices this change, too, and which reminds the
   Vipassana meditator to maintain that extra little mental sharpness needed to keep these
   more desirable states of mind. Mindfulness makes possible the growth of wisdom and
   compassion. Without Mindfulness they cannot develop to full maturity.
   
   Deeply buried in the mind, there lies a mental mechanism which accepts what the mind
   perceives as beautiful and pleasant experiences and rejects those experiences which are
   perceived as ugly and painful. This mechanism gives rise to those states of mind which
   we are training ourselves to avoid - things like greed, lust, hatred, aversion, and
   jealousy. We choose to avoid these hindrances, not because they are evil in the normal
   sense of the word, but because they are compulsive; because they take the mind over and
   capture the attention completely; because they keep going round and round in tight
   little circles of thought; and because they seal us off from living reality.
   
   These hindrances cannot arise when Mindfulness is present. Mindfulness is attention to
   present time reality, and therefore, directly antithetical to the dazed state of mind
   which characterizes impediments. As meditators, it is only when we let our Mindfulness
   slip that the deep mechanisms of our mind take over - grasping, clinging and
   rejecting. Then resistance emerges and obscures our awareness. We do not notice that
   the change is taking place - we are too busy with a thought of revenge, or greed,
   whatever it may be. While an untrained person will continue in this state indefinitely,
   a trained meditator will soon realize what is happening. It is Mindfulness that notices
   the change. It is Mindfulness that remembers the training received and that focuses our
   attention so that the confusion fades away. And it is Mindfulness that then attempts to
   maintain itself indefinitely so that the resistance cannot arise again. Thus,
   Mindfulness is the specific antidote for hindrances. It is both the cure and the
   preventive measure.
   
   Fully developed Mindfulness is a state of total non-attachment and utter absence of
   clinging to anything in the world. If we can maintain this state, no other means or
   device is needed to keep ourselves free of obstructions, to achieve liberation from our
   human weaknesses. Mindfulness is non-superficial awareness. It sees things deeply, down
   below the level of concepts and opinions. This sort of deep observation leads to total
   certainty, and complete absence of confusion. It manifests itself primarily as a
   constant and unwavering attention which never flags and never turns away.
   
   This pure and unstained investigative awareness not only holds mental hindrances at
   bay, it lays bare their very mechanism and destroys them. Mindfulness neutralizes
   defilements in the mind. The result is a mind which remains unstained and invulnerable,
   completely unaffected by the ups and downs of life.
* Chapter 14 - Mindfulness Versus Concentration
  Vipassana meditation is something of a mental balancing act. You are going to be
  cultivating two separate qualities of the mind - mindfulness and concentration. Ideally
  these two work together as a team. They pull in tandem, so to speak. Therefore it is
  important to cultivate them side-by-side and in a balanced manner. If one of the factors
  is strengthened at the expense of the other, the balance of the mind is lost and
  meditation impossible.
  
  Concentration and mindfulness are distinctly different functions. They each have their
  role to play in meditation, and the relationship between them is definite and
  delicate. Concentration is often called one-pointedness of mind. It consists of forcing
  the mind to remain on one static point. Please note the word FORCE. Concentration is
  pretty much a forced type of activity. It can be developed by force, by sheer
  unremitting willpower. And once developed, it retains some of that forced
  flavor. Mindfulness, on the other hand, is a delicate function leading to refined
  sensibilities. These two are partners in the job of meditation. Mindfulness is the
  sensitive one. He notices things. Concentration provides the power. He keeps the
  attention pinned down to one item. Ideally, mindfulness is in this
  relationship. Mindfulness picks the objects of attention, and notices when the attention
  has gone astray. Concentration does the actual work of holding the attention steady on
  that chosen object. If either of these partners is weak, your meditation goes astray.
  
  Concentration could be defined as that faculty of the mind which focuses single mindedly
  on one object without interruption. It must be emphasized that true concentration is a
  wholesome one-pointedness of mind. That is, the state is free from greed, hatred and
  delusion. Unwholesome one-pointedness is also possible, but it will not lead to
  liberation. You can be very single-minded in a state of lust. But that gets you
  nowhere. Uninterrupted focus on something that you hate does not help you at all. In
  fact, such unwholesome concentration is fairly short-lived even when it is achieved -
  especially when it is used to harm others. True concentration itself is free from such
  contaminants. It is a state in which the mind is gathered together and thus gains power
  and intensity. We might use the analogy of a lens. Parallel waves of sunlight falling on
  a piece of paper will do no more than warm the surface. But the same amount of light,
  when focused through a lens, falls on a single point and the paper bursts into
  flames. Concentration is the lens. It produces the burning intensity necessary to see
  into the deeper reaches of the mind. Mindfulness selects the object that the lens will
  focus on and looks through the lens to see what is there.
  
  Concentration should be regarded as a tool. Like any tool, it can be used for good or
  for ill. A sharp knife can be used to create a beautiful carving or to harm someone. It
  is all up to the one who uses the knife. Concentration is similar. Properly used, it can
  assist you towards liberation. But it can also be used in the service of the ego. It can
  operate in the framework of achievement and competition. You can use concentration to
  dominate others. You can use it to be selfish. The real problem is that concentration
  alone will not give you a perspective on yourself. It won't throw light on the basic
  problems of selfishness and the nature of suffering. It can be used to dig down into
  deep psychological states. But even then, the forces of egotism won't be
  understood. Only mindfulness can do that. If mindfulness is not there to look into the
  lens and see what has been uncovered, then it is all for nothing. Only mindfulness
  understands. Only mindfulness brings wisdom. Concentration has other limitations, too.
  
  Really deep concentration can only take place under certain specific
  conditions. Buddhists go to a lot of trouble to build meditation halls and
  monasteries. Their main purpose is to create a physical environment free of distractions
  in which to learn this skill. No noise, no interruptions. Just as important, however, is
  the creation of a distraction-free emotional environment. The development of
  concentration will be blocked by the presence of certain mental states which we call the
  five hindrances. They are greed for sensual pleasure, hatred, mental lethargy,
  restlessness, and mental vacillation. We have examined these mental states more fully in
  Chapter 12.
  
  A monastery is a controlled environment where this sort of emotional noise is kept to a
  minimum. No members of the opposite sex are allowed to live together there. Therefore,
  there is less opportunity for lust. No possessions are allowed. Therefore, no ownership
  squabbles and less chance for greed and coveting. Another hurdle for concentration
  should also be mentioned. In really deep concentration, you get so absorbed in the
  object of concentration that you forget all about trifles. Like your body, for instance,
  and your identity and everything around you. Here again the monastery is a useful
  convenience. It is nice to know that there is somebody to take care of you by watching
  over all the mundane matters of food and physical security. Without such assurance, one
  hesitates to go as deeply into concentration as one might.
  
  Mindfulness, on the other hand, is free from all these drawbacks. Mindfulness is not
  dependent on any such particular circumstance, physical or otherwise. it is a pure
  noticing factor. Thus it is free to notice whatever comes up - lust, hatred, or
  noise. Mindfulness is not limited by any condition. It exists to some extent in every
  moment, in every circumstance that arises. Also, mindfulness has no fixed object of
  focus. It observes change. Thus it has an unlimited number of objects of attention. It
  just looks at whatever is passing through the mind and it does not
  categorize. Distractions and interruptions are noticed with the same amount of attention
  as the formal objects of meditation. In a state of pure mindfulness your attention just
  flows along with whatever changes are taking place in the mind. "Shift, shift,
  shift. Now this, now this, and now this."
  
  You can't develop mindfulness by force. Active teeth gritting willpower won't do you any
  good at all. As a matter of fact, it will hinder progress. Mindfulness cannot be
  cultivated by struggle. It grows by realizing, by letting go, by just settling down in
  the moment and letting yourself get comfortable with whatever you are experiencing. This
  does not mean that mindfulness happens all by itself. Far from it. Energy is
  required. Effort is required. But this effort is different from force. Mindfulness is
  cultivated by a gentle effort, by effortless effort. The meditator cultivates
  mindfulness by constantly reminding himself in a gently way to maintain his awareness of
  whatever is happening right now. Persistence and a light touch are the
  secrets. Mindfulness is cultivated by constantly pulling oneself back to a state of
  awareness, gently, gently, gently.
  
  Mindfulness can't be used in any selfish way, either. it is nonegoistic alertness. There
  is no 'me' in a state of pure mindfulness. So there is no self to be selfish. On the
  contrary, it is mindfulness which gives you the real perspective on yourself. It allows
  you to take that crucial mental step backward from your own desires and aversions so
  that you can then look and say, "Ah ha, so that's how I really am."
  
  In a state of mindfulness, you see yourself exactly as you are. You see your own selfish
  behavior. You see your own suffering. And you see how you create that suffering. You see
  how you hurt others. You pierce right through the layer of lies that you normally tell
  yourself and you see what is really there. Mindfulness leads to wisdom.
  
  Mindfulness is not trying to achieve anything. It is just looking. Therefore, desire and
  aversion are not involved. Competition and struggle for achievement have no place in the
  process. Mindfulness does not aim at anything. It just sees whatever is already there.
  
  Mindfulness is a broader and larger function than concentration. It is an
  all-encompassing function. Concentration is exclusive. It settles down on one item and
  ignores everything else. Mindfulness is inclusive. It stands back from the focus of
  attention and watches with a broad focus, quick to notice any change that occurs. If you
  have focused the mind on a stone, concentration will see only the stone. Mindfulness
  stands back from this process, aware of the stone, aware of the concentration focusing
  on the stone, aware of the intensity of that focus and instantly aware of the shift of
  attention when concentration is distracted. It is mindfulness which notices the
  distraction which has occurred, and it is mindfulness which redirects the attention to
  the stone. Mindfulness is more difficult to cultivate than concentration because it is a
  deeper-reaching function. Concentration is merely focusing of the mind, rather like a
  laser beam. It has the power to burn its way deep into the mind and illuminate what is
  there. But it does not understand what it sees. Mindfulness can examine the mechanics of
  selfishness and understand what it sees. Mindfulness can pierce the mystery of suffering
  and the mechanism of discomfort. Mindfulness can make you free.
  
  There is, however, another Catch-22. Mindfulness does not react to what it sees. It just
  sees and understands. Mindfulness is the essence of patience. Therefore, whatever you
  see must be simply accepted, acknowledged and dispassionately observed. This is not
  easy, but it is utterly necessary. We are ignorant. We are selfish and greedy and
  boastful. We lust and we lie. These are facts. Mindfulness means seeing these facts and
  being patient with ourselves, accepting ourselves as we are. That goes against the
  grain. We don't want to accept. We want to deny it. Or change it, or justify it. But
  acceptance is the essence of mindfulness. If we want to grow in mindfulness we must
  accept what mindfulness finds. It may be boredom, irritation, or fear. It may be
  weakness, inadequacy, or faults. Whatever it is, that is the way we are. That is what is
  real.
  
  Mindfulness simply accepts whatever is there. If you want to grow in mindfulness,
  patient acceptance is the only route. Mindfulness grows only one way: by continuous
  practice of mindfulness, by simply trying to be mindful, and that means being
  patient. The process cannot be forced and it cannot be rushed. It proceeds at its own
  pace.
  
  Concentration and mindfulness go hand-in-hand in the job of meditation. Mindfulness
  directs the power of concentration. Mindfulness is the manager of the
  operation. Concentration furnishes the power by which mindfulness can penetrate into the
  deepest level of the mind. Their cooperation results in insight and understanding. These
  must be cultivated together in a balanced ratio. Just a bit more emphasis is given to
  mindfulness because mindfulness is the center of meditation. The deepest levels of
  concentration are not really needed to do the job of liberation. Still, a balance is
  essential. Too much awareness without calm to balance it will result in a wildly over
  sensitized state similar to abusing LSD. Too much concentration without a balancing
  ratio of awareness will result in the 'Stone Buddha' syndrome. The meditator gets so
  tranquilized that he sits there like a rock. Both of these are to be avoided.
  
  The initial stages of mental cultivation are especially delicate. Too much emphasis on
  mindfulness at this point will actually retard the development of concentration. When
  getting started in meditation, one of the first things you will notice is how incredibly
  active the mind really is. The Theravada tradition calls this phenomenon 'monkey
  mind'. The Tibetan tradition likens it to a waterfall of thought. If you emphasize the
  awareness function at this point, there will be so much to be aware of that
  concentration will be impossible. Don't get discouraged. This happens to everybody. And
  there is a simple solution. Put most of your effort into one-pointedness at the
  beginning. Just keep calling the attention from wandering over and over again. Tough it
  out. Full instructions on how to do this are in Chapters 7 and 8. A couple of months
  down the track and you will have developed concentration power. Then you can start
  pumping your energy into mindfulness. Do not, however, go so far with concentration that
  you find yourself going into a stupor.
  
  Mindfulness still is the more important of the two components. It should be built as
  soon as you comfortably can do so. Mindfulness provides the needed foundation for the
  subsequent development of deeper concentration. Most blunders in this area of balance
  will correct themselves in time. Right concentration develops naturally in the wake of
  strong mindfulness. The more you develop the noticing factor, the quicker you will
  notice the distraction and the quicker you will pull out of it and return to the formal
  object of attention. The natural result is increased concentration. And as concentration
  develops, it assists the development of mindfulness. The more concentration power you
  have, the less chance there is of launching off on a long chain of analysis about the
  distraction. You simply note the distraction and return your attention to where it is
  supposed to be.
  
  Thus the two factors tend to balance and support each other's growth quite
  naturally. Just about the only rule you need to follow at this point is to put your
  effort on concentration at the beginning, until the monkey mind phenomenon has cooled
  down a bit. After that, emphasize mindfulness. If you find yourself getting frantic,
  emphasize concentration. If you find yourself going into a stupor, emphasize
  mindfulness. Overall, mindfulness is the one to emphasize.
  
  Mindfulness guides your development in meditation because mindfulness has the ability to
  be aware of itself. It is mindfulness which will give you a perspective on your
  practice. Mindfulness will let you know how you are doing. But don't worry too much
  about that. This is not a race. You are not in competition with anybody, and there is no
  schedule.
  
  One of the most difficult things to learn is that mindfulness is not dependent on any
  emotional or mental state. We have certain images of meditation. Meditation is something
  done in quiet caves by tranquil people who move slowly. Those are training
  conditions. They are set up to foster concentration and to learn the skill of
  mindfulness. Once you have learned that skill, however, you can dispense with the
  training restrictions, and you should. You don't need to move at a snail's pace to be
  mindful. You don't even need to be calm. You can be mindful while solving problems in
  intensive calculus. You can be mindful in the middle of a football scrimmage. You can
  even be mindful in the midst of a raging fury. Mental and physical activities are no bar
  to mindfulness. If you find your mind extremely active, then simply observe the nature
  and degree of that activity. It is just a part of the passing show within.
* Chapter 15 - Meditation In Everyday Life
  Every musician plays scales. When you begin to study the piano, that's the first thing
  you learn, and you never stop playing scales. The finest concert pianists in the world
  still play scales. It's a basic skill that can't be allowed to get rusty.
  
  Every baseball player practices batting. It's the first thing you learn in Little
  League, and you never stop practicing. Every World Series game begins with batting
  practice. Basic skills must always remain sharp.
  
  Seated meditation is the arena in which the meditator practices his own fundamental
  skills. The game the meditator is playing is the experience of his own life, and the
  instrument upon which he plays is his own sensory apparatus. Even the most seasoned
  meditator continues to practice seated meditation, because it tunes and sharpens the
  basic mental skills he needs for his particular game. We must never forget, however,
  that seated meditation itself is not the game. It's the practice. The game in which
  those basic skills are to be applied is the rest of one's experiential
  existence. Meditation that is not applied to daily living is sterile and limited.
  
  The purpose of Vipassana meditation is nothing less than the radical and permanent
  transformation of your entire sensory and cognitive experience. It is meant to
  revolutionize the whole of your life experience. Those periods of seated practice are
  times set aside for instilling new mental habits. You learn new ways to receive and
  understand sensation. You develop new methods of dealing with conscious thought, and new
  modes of attending to the incessant rush of your own emotions. These new mental
  behaviors must be made to carry over into the rest of your life. Otherwise, meditation
  remains dry and fruitless, a theoretical segment of your existence that is unconnected
  to all the rest. Some effort to connect these two segments is essential. A certain
  amount of carry-over will take place spontaneously, but the process will be slow and
  unreliable. You are very likely to be left with the feeling that you are getting nowhere
  and to drop the process as unrewarding.
  
  One of the most memorable events in your meditation career is the moment when you first
  realize that you are meditating in the midst of some perfectly ordinary activity. You
  are driving down the freeway or carrying out the trash and it just turns on by
  itself. This unplanned outpouring of the skills you have been so carefully fostering is
  a genuine joy. It gives you a tiny window on the future. You catch a spontaneous glimpse
  of what the practice really means. The possibility strikes you that this transformation
  of consciousness could actually become a permanent feature of your experience. You
  realize that you could actually spend the rest of your days standing aside from the
  debilitating clamoring of your own obsessions, no longer frantically hounded by your own
  needs and greed. You get a tiny taste of what it is like to just stand aside and watch
  it all flow past. It's a magic moment.
  
  That vision is liable to remain unfulfilled, however, unless you actively seek to
  promote the carry-over process. The most important moment in meditation is the instant
  you leave the cushion. When your practice session is over, you can jump up and drop the
  whole thing, or you can bring those skills with you into the rest of your activities.
  
  It is crucial for you to understand what meditation is. It is not some special posture,
  and it's not just a set of mental exercises. Meditation is a cultivation of mindfulness
  and the application of that mindfulness once cultivated. You do not have to sit to
  meditate. You can meditate while washing the dishes. You can meditate in the shower, or
  roller skating, or typing letters. Meditation is awareness, and it must be applied to
  each and every activity of one's life. This isn't easy.
  
  We specifically cultivate awareness through the seated posture in a quiet place because
  that's the easiest situation in which to do so. Meditation in motion is
  harder. Meditation in the midst of fast-paced noisy activity is harder still. And
  meditation in the midst of intensely egoistic activities like romance or arguments is
  the ultimate challenge. The beginner will have his hands full with less stressful
  activities.
  
  Yet the ultimate goal of practice remains: to build one's concentration and awareness to
  a level of strength that will remain unwavering even in the midst of the pressures of
  life in contemporary society. Life offers many challenges and the serious meditator is
  very seldom bored.
  
  Carrying your meditation into the events of your daily life is not a simple process. Try
  it and you will see. That transition point between the end of your meditation session
  and the beginning of 'real life' is a long jump. It's too long for most of us. We find
  our calm and concentration evaporating within minutes, leaving us apparently no better
  off than before. In order to bridge this gulf, Buddhists over the centuries have devised
  an array of exercises aimed at smoothing the transition. They take that jump and break
  it down into little steps. Each step can be practiced by itself.
  
** 1. Walking Meditation
   
   Our everyday existence is full of motion and activity. Sitting utterly motionless for
   hours on end is nearly the opposite of normal experience. Those states of clarity and
   tranquility we foster in the midst of absolute stillness tend to dissolve as soon as we
   move. We need some transitional exercise that will teach us the skill of remaining calm
   and aware in the midst of motion. Walking meditation helps us make that transition from
   static repose to everyday life. It's meditation in motion, and it is often used as an
   alternative to sitting. Walking is especially good for those times when you are
   extremely restless. An hour of walking meditation will often get you through that
   restless energy and still yield considerable quantities of clarity. You can then go on
   to the seated meditation with greater profit.
   
   Standard Buddhist practice advocates frequent retreats to complement your daily sitting
   practice. A retreat is a relatively long period of time devoted exclusively to
   meditation. One or two day retreats are common for lay people. Seasoned meditators in a
   monastic situation may spend months at a time doing nothing else. Such practice is
   rigorous, and it makes sizable demands on both mind and body. Unless you have been at
   it for several years, there is a limit to how long you can sit and profit. Ten solid
   hours of the seated posture will produce in most beginners a state of agony that far
   exceeds their concentration powers. A profitable retreat must therefore be conducted
   with some change of posture and some movement. The usual pattern is to intersperse
   blocks of sitting with blocks of walking meditation. An hour of each with short breaks
   between is common.
   
   To do the walking meditation, you need a private place with enough space for at least
   five to ten paces in a straight line. You are going to be walking back and forth very
   slowly, and to the eyes of most Westerners, you'll look curious and disconnected from
   everyday life. This is not the sort of exercise you want to perform on the front lawn
   where you'll attract unnecessary attention. Choose a private place.
   
   The physical directions are simple. Select an unobstructed area and start at one
   end. Stand for a minute in an attentive position. Your arms can be held in any way that
   is comfortable, in front, in back, or at your sides. Then while breathing in, lift the
   heel of one foot. While breathing out, rest that foot on its toes. Again while
   breathing in, lift that foot, carry it forward and while breathing out, bring the foot
   down and touch the floor. Repeat this for the other foot. Walk very slowly to the
   opposite end, stand for one minute, then turn around very slowly, and stand there for
   another minute before you walk back. Then repeat the process. Keep you head up and you
   neck relaxed. Keep your eyes open to maintain balance, but don't look at anything in
   particular. Walk naturally. Maintain the slowest pace that is comfortable, and pay not
   attention to your surroundings. Watch out for tensions building up in the body, and
   release them as soon as you spot them. Don't make any particular attempt to be
   graceful. Don't try to look pretty. This is not an athletic exercise, or a dance. It is
   an exercise in awareness. Your objective is to attain total alertness, heightened
   sensitivity and a full, unblocked experience of the motion of walking. Put all of your
   attention on the sensations coming from the feet and legs. Try to register as much
   information as possible about each foot as it moves. Dive into the pure sensation of
   walking, and notice every subtle nuance of the movement. Feel each individual muscle as
   it moves. Experience every tiny change in tactile sensation as the feet press against
   the floor and then lift again.
   
   Notice the way these apparently smooth motions are composed of complex series of tiny
   jerks. Try to miss nothing. In order to heighten your sensitivity, you can break the
   movement down into distinct components. Each foot goes through a lift, a swing; and
   then a down tread. Each of these components has a beginning, middle, and end. In order
   to tune yourself in to this series of motions, you can start by making explicit mental
   notes of each stage. Make a mental note of "lifting, swinging, coming down, touching
   floor, pressing" and so on. This is a training procedure to familiarize you with the
   sequence of motions and to make sure that you don't miss any. As you become more aware
   of the myriad subtle events going on, you won't have time for words. You will find
   yourself immersed in a fluid, unbroken awareness of motion. The feet will become your
   whole universe. If your mind wanders, note the distraction in the usual way, then
   return your attention to walking. Don't look at your feet while you are doing all of
   this, and don't walk back and forth watching a mental picture of your feet and
   legs. Don't think, just feel. You don't need the concept of feet and you don't need
   pictures. Just register the sensations as they flow. In the beginning, you will
   probably have some difficulties with balance. You are using the leg muscles in a new
   way, and a learning period is natural. If frustration arises, just note that and let it
   go.
   
   The Vipassana walking technique is designed to flood your consciousness with simple
   sensations, and to do it so thoroughly that all else is pushed aside. There is no room
   for thought and no room for emotion. There is no time for grasping, and none for
   freezing the activity into a series of concepts. There is no need for a sense of
   self. There is only the sweep of tactile and kinesthetic sensation, an endless and
   ever-changing flood of raw experience. We are learning here to escape into reality,
   rather than from it. Whatever insights we gain are directly applicable to the rest of
   our notion-filled lives.
   
** 2. Postures
   
   The goal of our practice is to become fully aware of all facets of our experience in an
   unbroken, moment-to-moment flow. Much of what we do and experience is completely
   unconscious in the sense that we do it with little or no attention. Our minds are on
   something else entirely. We spend most of our time running on automatic pilot, lost in
   the fog of day-dreams and preoccupations.
   
   One of the most frequently ignored aspects of our existence is our body. The
   technicolor cartoon show inside our head is so alluring that we tend to remove all of
   our attention from the kinesthetic and tactile senses. That information is pouring up
   the nerves and into the brain every second, but we have largely sealed it off from
   consciousness. It pours into the lower levels of the mind and it gets no
   further. Buddhists have developed an exercise to open the floodgates and let this
   material through to consciousness. It's another way of making the unconscious
   conscious.
   
   Your body goes through all kinds of contortions in the course of a single day. You sit
   and you stand. You walk and lie down. You bend, run, crawl, and sprawl. Meditation
   teachers urge you to become aware of this constantly ongoing dance. As you go through
   your day, spend a few seconds every few minutes to check your posture. Don't do it in a
   judgmental way. This is not an exercise to correct your posture, or to improve you
   appearance. Sweep your attention down through the body and feel how you are holding
   it. Make a silent mental note of 'Walking' or 'Sitting' or 'Lying down' or
   'Standing'. It all sounds absurdly simple, but don't slight this procedure. This is a
   powerful exercise. If you do it thoroughly, if you really instil this mental habit
   deeply, it can revolutionize your experience. It taps you into a whole new dimension of
   sensation, and you feel like a blind man whose sight has been restored.
   
** 3. Slow-Motion Activity
   
   Every action you perform is made up of separate components. The simple action of tying
   your shoelaces is made up of a complex series of subtle motions. Most of these details
   go unobserved. In order to promote the overall habit of mindfulness, you can perform
   simple activities at very low speed - making an effort to pay full attention to every
   nuance of the act.
   
   Sitting at a table and drinking a cup of tea is one example. There is much here to be
   experienced. View your posture as you are sitting and feel the handle of the cup
   between your fingers. Smell the aroma of the tea, notice the placement of the cup, the
   tea, your arm, and the table. Watch the intention to raise the arm arise within your
   mind, feel the arm as it raises, feel the cup against your lips and the liquid pouring
   into your mouth. Taste the tea, then watch the arising of the intention to lower your
   arm. The entire process is fascinating and beautiful, if you attend to it fully, paying
   detached attention to every sensation and to the flow of thought and emotion.
   
   This same tactic can be applied to many of your daily activities. Intentionally slowing
   down your thoughts, words and movements allows you to penetrate far more deeply into
   them than you otherwise could. What you find there is utterly astonishing. In the
   beginning, it is very difficult to keep this deliberately slow pace during most regular
   activities, but skill grows with time. Profound realizations occur during sitting
   meditation, but even more profound revelations can take place when we really examine
   our own inner workings in the midst of day-to-day activities. This is the laboratory
   where we really start to see the mechanisms of our own emotions and the operations of
   our passions. Here is where we can truly gauge the reliability of our reasoning, and
   glimpse the difference between our true motives and the armor of pretense that we wear
   to fool ourselves and others.
   
   We will find a great deal of this information surprising, much of it disturbing, but
   all of it useful. Bare attention brings order into the clutter that collects in those
   untidy little hidden corners of the mind. As you achieve clear comprehension in the
   midst of life's ordinary activities, you gain the ability to remain rational and
   peaceful while you throw the penetrating light of mindfulness into those irrational
   mental nooks and crannies. You start to see the extent to which you are responsible for
   your own mental suffering. You see your own miseries, fears, and tensions as
   self-generated. You see the way you cause your own suffering, weakness, and
   limitations. And the more deeply you understand these mental processes, the less hold
   they have on you.
   
** 4. Breath Coordination
   
   In seated meditation, our primary focus is the breath. Total concentration on the
   ever-changing breath brings us squarely into the present moment. The same principle can
   be used in the midst of movement. You can coordinate the activity in which you are
   involved with your breathing. This lends a flowing rhythm to your movement, and it
   smooths out many of the abrupt transitions. Activity becomes easier to focus on, and
   mindfulness is increased. Your awareness thus stays more easily in the
   present. Ideally, meditation should be a 24 hour-a-day practice. This is a highly
   practical suggestion.
   
   A state of mindfulness is a state of mental readiness. The mind is not burdened with
   preoccupations or bound in worries. Whatever comes up can be dealt with instantly. When
   you are truly mindful, your nervous system has a freshness and resiliency which fosters
   insight. A problem arises and you simply deal with it, quickly, efficiently, and with a
   minimum of fuss. You don't stand there in a dither, and you don't run off to a quiet
   corner so you can sit down and meditate about it. You simply deal with it. And in those
   rare circumstances when no solution seems possible, you don't worry about that. You
   just go on to the next thing that needs your attention. Your intuition becomes a very
   practical faculty.
   
** 5. Stolen Moments
   
   The concept of wasted time does not exist for a serious meditator. Little dead spaces
   during your day can be turned to profit. Every spare moment can be used for
   meditation. Sitting anxiously in the dentist's office, meditate on your
   anxiety. Feeling irritated while standing in a line at the bank, meditate on
   irritation. Bored, twiddling you thumbs at the bus stop, meditate on boredom. Try to
   stay alert and aware throughout the day. Be mindful of exactly what is taking place
   right now, even if it is tedious drudgery. Take advantage of moments when you are
   alone. Take advantage of activities that are largely mechanical. Use every spare second
   to be mindful. Use all the moments you can.
   
** 6. Concentration On All Activities
   
   You should try to maintain mindfulness of every activity and perception through the
   day, starting with the first perception when you awake, and ending with the last
   thought before you fall asleep. This is an incredibly tall goal to shoot for. Don't
   expect to be able to achieve this work soon. Just take it slowly and let you abilities
   grow over time. The most feasible way to go about the task is to divide your day up
   into chunks. Dedicate a certain interval to mindfulness of posture, then extend this
   mindfulness to other simple activities: eating, washing, dressing, and so forth. Some
   time during the day, you can set aside 15 minutes or so to practice the observation of
   specific types of mental states: pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral feelings, for
   instance; or the hindrances, or thoughts. The specific routine is up to you. The idea
   is to get practice at spotting the various items, and to preserve your state of
   mindfulness as fully as you can throughout the day.
   
   Try to achieve a daily routine in which there is as little difference as possible
   between seated meditation and the rest of your experience. Let the one slide naturally
   into the other. Your body is almost never still. There is always motion to observe. At
   the very least, there is breathing. Your mind never stops chattering, except in the
   very deepest states of concentration. There is always something coming up to
   observe. If you seriously apply your meditation, you will never be at a loss for
   something worthy of your attention.
   
   Your practice must be made to apply to your everyday living situation. That is your
   laboratory. It provides the trials and challenges you need to make your practice deep
   and genuine. It's the fire that purifies your practice of deception and error, the acid
   test that shows you when you are getting somewhere and when you are fooling
   yourself. If your meditation isn't helping you to cope with everyday conflicts and
   struggles, then it is shallow. If your day-to-day emotional reactions are not becoming
   clearer and easier to manage, then you are wasting your time. And you never know how
   you are doing until you actually make that test.
   
   The practice of mindfulness is supposed to be a universal practice. You don't do it
   sometimes and drop it the rest of the time. You do it all the time. Meditation that is
   successful only when you are withdrawn in some soundproof ivory tower is still
   undeveloped. Insight meditation is the practice of moment-to-moment mindfulness. The
   meditator learns to pay bare attention to the birth, growth, and decay of all the
   phenomena of the mind. He turns from none of it, and he lets none of it
   escape. Thoughts and emotions, activities and desires, the whole show. He watches it
   all and he watches it continuously. It matters not whether it is lovely or horrid,
   beautiful or shameful. He sees the way it is and the way it changes. No aspect of
   experience is excluded or avoided. It is a very thoroughgoing procedure.
   
   If you are moving through your daily activities and you find yourself in a state of
   boredom, then meditate on your boredom. Find out how it feels, how it works, and what
   it is composed of. If you are angry, meditate on the anger. Explore the mechanics of
   anger. Don't run from it. If you find yourself sitting in the grip of a dark
   depression, meditate on the depression. Investigate depression in a detached and
   inquiring way. Don't flee from it blindly. Explore the maze and chart its
   pathways. That way you will be better able to cope with the next depression that comes
   along.
   
   Meditating your way through the ups and downs of daily life is the whole point of
   Vipassana. This kind of practice is extremely rigorous and demanding, but it engenders
   a state of mental flexibility that is beyond comparison. A meditator keeps his mind
   open every second. He is constantly investigating life, inspecting his own experience,
   viewing existence in a detached and inquisitive way. Thus he is constantly open to
   truth in any form, from any source, and at any time. This is the state of mind you need
   for Liberation.
   
   It is said that one may attain enlightenment at any moment if the mind is kept in a
   state of meditative readiness. The tiniest, most ordinary perception can be the
   stimulus: a view of the moon, the cry of a bird, the sound of the wind in the
   trees. It's not so important what is perceived as the way in which you attend to that
   perception. The state of open readiness is essential. It could happen to you right now
   if you are ready. The tactile sensation of this book in your fingers could be the
   cue. the sound of these words in your head might be enough. You could attain
   enlightenment right now, if you are ready.
* Chapter 16 - What's In It For You
  You can expect certain benefits from your meditation. The initial ones are practical,
  prosaic things; the later stages are profoundly transcendent. They run together from the
  simple to the sublime. We will set forth some of them here. Your own experience is all
  that counts.
  
  Those things that we called hindrances or defilements are more than just unpleasant
  mental habits. They are the primary manifestations of the ego process itself. The ego
  sense itself is essentially a feeling of separation--a perception of distance between
  that which we call me, and that which we call other. This perception is held in place
  only if it is constantly exercised, and the hindrances constitute that exercise.
  
  Greed and lust are attempts to get 'some of that' for me; hatred and aversion are
  attempts to place greater distance between 'me and that'. All the defilements depend
  upon the perception of a barrier between self and other, and all of them foster this
  perception every time they are exercised. Mindfulness perceives things deeply and with
  great clarity. It brings our attention to the root of the defilements and lays bare
  their mechanism. It sees their fruits and their effects upon us. It cannot be
  fooled. Once you have clearly seen what greed really is and what it really does to you
  and to others, you just naturally cease to engage in it. When a child burns his hand on
  a hot oven, you don't have to tell him to pull it back; he does it naturally, without
  conscious thought and without decision. There is a reflex action built into the nervous
  system for just that purpose, and it works faster than thought. By the time the child
  perceives the sensation of heat and begins to cry, the hand has already been jerked back
  from the source of pain. Mindfulness works in very much the same way: it is wordless,
  spontaneous and utterly efficient. Clear mindfulness inhibits the growth of hindrances;
  continuous mindfulness extinguishes them. Thus, as genuine mindfulness is built up, the
  walls of the ego itself are broken down, craving diminishes, defensiveness and rigidity
  lessen, you become more open, accepting and flexible. You learn to share your
  loving-kindness.
  
  Traditionally, Buddhists are reluctant to talk about the ultimate nature of human
  beings. But those who are willing to make descriptive statements at all usually say that
  our ultimate essence or Buddha nature is pure, holy and inherently good. The only reason
  that human beings appear otherwise is that their experience of that ultimate essence has
  been hindered; it has been blocked like water behind a dam. The hindrances are the
  bricks of which the dam is built. As mindfulness dissolves the bricks, holes are punched
  in the dam and compassion and sympathetic joy come flooding forward. As meditative
  mindfulness develops, your whole experience of life changes. Your experience of being
  alive, the very sensation of being conscious, becomes lucid and precise, no longer just
  an unnoticed background for your preoccupations. It becomes a thing consistently
  perceived.
  
  Each passing moment stands out as itself; the moments no longer blend together in an
  unnoticed blur. Nothing is glossed over or taken for granted, no experiences labeled as
  merely 'ordinary'. Everything looks bright and special. You refrain from categorizing
  your experiences into mental pigeonholes. Descriptions and interpretations are chucked
  aside and each moment of time is allowed to speak for itself. You actually listen to
  what it has to say, and you listen as if it were being heard for the very first
  time. When your meditation becomes really powerful, it also becomes constant. You
  consistently observe with bare attention both the breath and every mental
  phenomenon. You feel increasingly stable, increasingly moored in the stark and simple
  experience of moment-to-moment existence.
  
  Once your mind is free from thought, it becomes clearly wakeful and at rest in an
  utterly simple awareness. This awareness cannot be described adequately. Words are not
  enough. It can only be experienced. Breath ceases to be just breath; it is no longer
  limited to the static and familiar concept you once held. You no longer see it as a
  succession of just inhalations and exhalations; it is no longer some insignificant
  monotonous experience. Breath becomes a living, changing process, something alive and
  fascinating. It is no longer something that takes place in time; it is perceived as the
  present moment itself. Time is seen as a concept, not an experienced reality.
  
  This is simplified, rudimentary awareness which is stripped of all extraneous detail. It
  is grounded in a living flow of the present, and it is marked by a pronounced sense of
  reality. You know absolutely that this is real, more real than anything you have ever
  experienced. Once you have gained this perception with absolute certainty, you have a
  fresh vantage point, a new criterion against which to gauge all of your
  experience. After this perception, you see clearly those moments when you are
  participating in bare phenomena alone, and those moments when you are disturbing
  phenomena with mental attitudes. You watch yourself twisting reality with mental
  comments, with stale images and personal opinions. You know what you are doing, when you
  are doing it. You become increasingly sensitive to the ways in which you miss the true
  reality, and you gravitate towards the simple objective perspective which does not add
  to or subtract from what is. You become a very perceptive individual. From this vantage
  point, all is seen with clarity. The innumerable activities of mind and body stand out
  in glaring detail. You mindfully observe the incessant rise and fall of breath; you
  watch an endless stream of bodily sensations and movements; you scan a rapid succession
  of thoughts and feelings, and you sense the rhythm that echoes from the steady march of
  time. And in the midst of all this ceaseless movement, there is no watcher, there is
  only watching.
  
  In this state of perception, nothing remains the same for two consecutive
  moments. Everything is seen to be in constant transformation. All things are born, all
  things grow old and die. There are no exceptions. You awaken to the unceasing changes of
  your own life. You look around and see everything in flux, everything, everything,
  everything. It is all rising and falling, intensifying and diminishing, coming into
  existence and passing away. All of life, every bit of it from the infinitesimal to the
  Indian Ocean, is in motion constantly. You perceive the universe as a great flowing
  river of experience. Your most cherished possessions are slipping away, and so is your
  very life. Yet this impermanence is no reason for grief. You stand there transfixed,
  staring at this incessant activity, and your response is wondrous joy. It's all moving,
  dancing and full of life.
  
  As you continue to observe these changes and you see how it all fits together, you
  become aware of the intimate connectedness of all mental, sensory and affective
  phenomena. You watch one thought leading to another, you see destruction giving rise to
  emotional reactions and feelings giving rise to more thoughts. Actions, thoughts,
  feelings, desires--you see all of them intimately linked together in a delicate fabric
  of cause and effect. You watch pleasurable experiences arise and fall and you see that
  they never last; you watch pain come uninvited and you watch yourself anxiously
  struggling to throw it off; you see yourself fail. It all happens over and over while
  you stand back quietly and just watch it all work.
  
  Out of this living laboratory itself comes an inner and unassailable conclusion. You see
  that your life is marked by disappointment and frustration, and you clearly see the
  source. These reactions arise out of your own inability to get what you want, your fear
  of losing what you have already gained and your habit of never being satisfied with what
  you have. These are no longer theoretical concepts - you have seen these things for
  yourself and you know that they are real. You perceive your own fear, your own basic
  insecurity in the face of life and death. It is a profound tension that goes all the way
  down to the root of thought and makes all of life a struggle. You watch yourself
  anxiously groping about, fearfully grasping for something, anything, to hold onto in the
  midst of all these shifting sands, and you see that there is nothing to hold onto,
  nothing that doesn't change.
  
  You see the pain of loss and grief, you watch yourself being forced to adjust to painful
  developments day after day in your own ordinary existence. You witness the tensions and
  conflicts inherent in the very process of everyday living, and you see how superficial
  most of your concerns really are. You watch the progress of pain, sickness, old age and
  death. You learn to marvel that all these horrible things are not fearful at all. They
  are simply reality.
  
  Through this intensive study of the negative aspects of your existence, you become
  deeply acquainted with dukkha, the unsatisfactory nature of all existence. You begin to
  perceive dukkha at all levels of our human life, from the obvious down to the most
  subtle. You see the way suffering inevitably follows in the wake of clinging, as soon as
  you grasp anything, pain inevitably follows. Once you become fully acquainted with the
  whole dynamic of desire, you become sensitized to it. You see where it rises, when it
  rises and how it affects you. You watch it operate over and over, manifesting through
  every sense channel, taking control of the mind and making consciousness its slave.
  
  In the midst of every pleasant experience, you watch your own craving and clinging take
  place. In the midst of unpleasant experiences, you watch a very powerful resistance take
  hold. You do not block these phenomena, you just watch them, you see them as the very
  stuff of human thought. You search for that thing you call 'me', but what you find is a
  physical body and how you have identified your sense of yourself with that bag of skin
  and bones. You search further and you find all manner of mental phenomena, such as
  emotions, thought patterns and opinions, and see how you identify the sense of yourself
  with each of them. You watch yourself becoming possessive, protective and defensive over
  these pitiful things and you see how crazy that is. You rummage furiously among these
  various items, constantly searching for yourself - physical matter, bodily sensations,
  feelings and emotions - it all keeps whirling round and round as you root through it,
  peering into every nook and cranny, endlessly hunting for 'me'.
  
  You find nothing. In all that collection of mental hardware in this endless stream of
  ever-shifting experience all you can find is innumerable impersonal processes which have
  been caused and conditioned by previous processes. There is no static self to be found;
  it is all process. You find thoughts but no thinker, you find emotions and desires, but
  nobody doing them. The house itself is empty. There is nobody home.
  
  Your whole view of self changes at this point. You begin to look upon yourself as if you
  were a newspaper photograph. When viewed with the naked eyes, the photograph you see is
  a definite image. When viewed through a magnifying glass, it all breaks down into an
  intricate configuration of dots. Similarly, under the penetrating gaze of mindfulness,
  the feeling of self, an 'I' or 'being' anything, loses its solidity and dissolves. There
  comes a point in insight meditation where the three characteristics of existence -
  impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and selflessness - come rushing home with
  concept-searing force. You vividly experience the impermanence of life, the suffering
  nature of human existence, and the truth of no self. You experience these things so
  graphically that you suddenly awake to the utter futility of craving, grasping and
  resistance. In the clarity and purity of this profound moment, our consciousness is
  transformed. The entity of self evaporates. All that is left is an infinity of
  interrelated non-personal phenomena which are conditioned and ever changing. Craving is
  extinguished and a great burden is lifted. There remains only an effortless flow,
  without a trace of resistance or tension. There remains only peace, and blessed Nibbana,
  the uncreated, is realized.
